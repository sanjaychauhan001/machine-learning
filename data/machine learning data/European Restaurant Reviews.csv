France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Rude manager,May 2024 •,The manager became agressive when I said the carbonara was not good. She was rude. It was  a very bad experience. The worst in Rome in many years.
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,A big disappointment,Feb 2024 •,"I ordered a beef fillet ask to be done medium, I got it well done cooked and very dry, when I told them they took the steak and after 20 minutes they brought me another steak that was completely rare, I left all the steak , and they asked me about it but charged me the fool price."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Pretty Place with Bland Food,Nov 2023 •,"This is an attractive venue with welcoming, albeit but somewhat slow service. The offerings are pleasingly presented but most everything has no taste. It was as though ingredients were just assembled without seasoning: a lovely restaurant, except for the food."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Great service and wine but inedible food,Mar 2023 •,"Sadly I  used the high TripAdvisor rating too literally. We have been fortunate to eat at a number of fine restaurants so  know that amazing buzz from  a mouthful of fine freshly cooked food from a great chef.
Never before have we eaten a tasting menu and never will we again.
Ad Hoc has a great ambience with attentive friendly service and all the paired wines were exceptional.
Maybe we hit a night when the chef was off but every single course of food was certainly not freshly cooked and , as we passed the kitchen on the way to the bathroom, noticed plates of  precooked food ready to go on the tasting menu plates. If it had been the odd dish that disappointed, we would have accepted that it might have just been our palates not liking it. As it was every plate of food was not hot, bland, lacking any spark and had probably been sitting around for a while.l
All the serving staff were great as was the wine but I failed to finish any plate offered. 
The tasting menu looked good value but a simple bowl of hot freshly cooked pasta would have done better justice to the wine.
When asked ,I admitted , with that great English understatement, that I had been disappointed. I found 17 euros had been deducted from the 190 euro bill so it was nice that they noticed.
Probably best to avoid the tasting menus and enjoy their great wine selection with some pasta and maybe cheese course.

I feel responsible that I made a poor choice not realizing that this is a place geared for tourists. 
An expensive mistake."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Avoid- Worst meal in Rome - possibly ever,Nov 2022 •,"From the start this meal was bad- especially given the price. We visited for my husbands birthday after being recommended by our local hotel. The lady in charge appeared at our table as we arrived to basically up-sell the truffle menu. Plonked some truffles on the table and then with no explanation of how they would enhance the dishes gave us a rehearsed speech which she proceeded to repeat word for word at every single table. If the food had been good we could have forgiven this but it wasn’t. The best parts were the bland bits as at least they were inoffensive - nothing was seasoned and sauces were completely tasteless with strange and weird combinations. But the worst part of the meal was my husbands inedible medallions of ‘lamb’ dish. This was made up of a tiny amount of lamb gristle and fat wrapped around some mushy stuff we couldn’t identify. Fillet of beef was sort of well cooked (frankly hard to get wrong) but served with exactly the same sauce as the lamb, some reconstituted mash in strange tube shapes and tasteless, watery spinach. We asked for wine recommendations. The wines were ok but we weren’t told what they were, they weren’t explained to us (I had to ask what mine was and was told it was ‘local’) and we weren’t offered any to try. With so much choice nearby and so many better (and much cheaper options) I’d avoid."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,"Shocking management, TERRIBLE service by mum and daughter!! FOR Tourist ONLY!!",Jul 2021 •,"We visited this restaurant on Saturday night and we had the most disappointing service and food experience ever. It was my partner's bday celebration weekend. 

The restaurant is run by a blonde Manager and her daughter wich had the most terrible attitude, they both made sure we will never be back there.
We were sitting at the table near the window but the ac was off and outside about 35 degrees. Halfway through our meal (truffle tasting menu with wine pairing), we asked to move anywhere else because it was too warm there.
The young waitress (the daughter) asked the manager (her mum) to move us, but she replies a very sharp NO!!!!! Also, a dog pooped just in front of us, on the pedestrian side, but apparently, according to the same waitress, that was nothing that concerned the restaurant. Anyhow now not only was it crazy hot but with a nice poo view too.
So we could not move anywhere even though the restaurant was empty, for no reason. Asked to talk to her mum (The Manager) she never touches the table or acknowledges us. How can you deny to a couple with 230 euro bills to move to another table when your restaurant is empty? 
Finally, a gem of a waitress with curly hair approached the table and moved us to another spot, where we spent the rest of the evening in confinement because as I said one side of the restaurant was empty for the whole night.
I have been managing restaurants for my whole life, and I never gave such an awful service and attitude to my guests.

The tempo of service completely wrong, food was getting to our table way earlier than wine.
The wine was poured into the glasses and set in the station for about 20 minutes before being served, subjected to the bacterias and dust since everyone was passing by.

Food was good but if you are used to first-class and fine dining service keep out from this place!"
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,We tired the tasting menu - avoid,Jan 2020 •,"We tired the tasting menu with wine pairing. The food was not interesting, not very tasty and overall wasted time and money. I would not come back and I would not recommend it"
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Huge Disappointment,Oct 2019 •,"This restaurant’s high rating is wholly unwarranted.  We were looking forward to Ad Hoc’s truffle menu this week with white truffles in season and left sorely disappointed.  The food was flavorless, served cold, and overpriced to boot.  It seemed as if the dishes had been made in advance and reheated.  The truffles inferior in quality and taste.  We dined at other restaurants in Rome the same week that served far more flavorful truffles at a much lower price, so recognize the difference!  The service was slow and disjointed.  The only thing that checked out were the wine pairings, which were fine.  Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Expensive mediocre food and service,Jun 2019 •,"We got the Tasting Menu and wine pairing. Frankly, the food wasn't tasty and the wine was boring. The service was completely impersonal and almost robotic. I would avoid this place at all costs, there are too many really good restaurants in Rome"
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,all around awful,May 2019 •,"My wife and I booked well in advance based on TA reviews. We were seated as we arrived and the interior was wonderful. We each ordered the pumpkin flower stuffed with cheese. They arrived about 30 minutes later stone cold and tasted like hard potato chips stuffed with a glob of cheese. We ate about 20% and told the waitress, who never came back to check, when she came to clear the plates that is was awful. She argued with us saying""well, that is how we make it."" About another 30 minutes passed and our second course arrive, again stone cold-it was a pasta dish that was way under cooked, not just al dente. We did not eat more than a few bites but sat there for about 20 minutes until someone came by to clear the plates-we told her that the food was not edible and asked for our waitress--after sitting for about 10-15 more minutes we decided to get up an leave-the waitress never appeared until we started to walk out and then she said our main course was ready. This was 2 hours after we arrived. We paid for the first two course even though a classy restaurant would not have charged at all, and walked out. The waitress was rude and the food awful and the service even worse."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,A big disappointment due to poor service and arrogant attitudes,Mar 2019 •,"Rome

A big disappointment--not service-oriented and arrogant.

I had high expectations for this restaurant, but when we got there, it turned out that they had put our party of 6 at a very large table for 8 completely off on its own at the back of the restaurant. The table was not conducive to good conversation and very awkward. When we asked for another table, our concerns were dismissed. When I wrote to the restaurant afterwards to complain about the situation, I got a very dismissive letter back from the owner, essentially stating: ""other people love this table; I guess you didn't."" No apology was offered.   Particularly given the price, I would not recommend this restaurant to others based on the poor treatment we received particularly given the many other wonderful alternatives in Rome.  If you do choose to go, I would specify where you would like to sit."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Perfectly organized absolute scam!,Dec 2018 •,The place offers really low quality overpriced food wrapped in a good environment with pretentious service well placed to create the atmosphere of a serious and high end restaurant. Packed with tourists should have given me a hint from the very beginning . Specializing in truffles allows you to have a segment peel of real truffle on your plate amongst many many fake ones. Fillet 47 euros was entrecôte and not a good one at that as well. Stay away at all costs !!!
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Disappointing,Sept 2018 •,"With so many complimentary reviews I was expecting so much more. The service so praised in other reviews was robotic and slow....Very slow. Our reservation was for 21:00. Our table wasn't ready, so we were invited to have a glass of prosecco in the bar. This was fine but we waited half an hour for the table. Once we got to the table we waited 20 minutes or so to have our order taken, although to be fair we were offered another glass of prosecco. We eventually got our amuse bouche at around 22:00 at least an hour after we arrived. 

We ordered the truffle set menu. The food ranged between being average and quite good, never really good. At odds with other reviews a few words of warning. The truffle menu is a poor choice. Truffle is delicious but a whole meal with the same flavour doesn't work. Second unless you are very hungry avoid the menus. The volume of food is enormous. We left quite a lot of the anti pasti and especially the pasta course. 

We eventually left around midnight. They clearly book more covers than they can efficiently deal with. 

My summary is...quantity rather than quality and slow robotic emotionless service probably caused by over booking."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,What a disaster...,Oct 2018 •,"I have to say that I was disappointed in my visit to Ad Hoc. While the location and decor were great I found the service to be terrible, in fact the service made the food a disappointment as well. 

It started with the 40 minute wait in between sitting down and a staff member our order for food or drinks. Our waitress seemed disappointed we didn't want to do the tasting menu, but we were already disappointed with the way the meal had started. It took another 30 minutes for our first glass of wine and burrata appetizer to arrive at the table. 

The burrata with the upgrade of white truffle. This dish was around $50, and when it arrived a small fly landed on it... No big deal it happens. When the waitress and I tried to get it off it was killed on the cheese. She asked if we wanted a new one... um, of course I said. Now after waiting 30 minutes for the dish to arrive at our table a ""new one"" was brought out in less than 5 minutes. I'm not sure that the 2nd burrata was new and that they threw away the original dish, given how expensive white truffles are, but it should have been. 

The 3 way carbonara came out practically cold too. No one ever came to see if we wanted another drink until the end of our meal. When we ordered wine glasses were just brought over a glass, no wine was ever presented to the table as with other restaurants in this price range. Some staff apologized at one point saying the service issues were because they were busy, I'm not sure how that was my problem. They hold themselves out as a fine dining experience and at least mine was far, far from that. I would tell you to ignore the inflated reviews and look for something better."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Great wines but average food,Jul 2018 •,"We both ate the truffle tasting menu with wines. The appetizer where good but the first and second course where nothing special at all. A decent meal with some truffle for a BIG price tag. The dessert where fine and the wines was really good.
But for this price everything should be GREAT."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Utterly inept in every way,May 2018 •,"And pretentious to go along with it.  What can you say about a restaurant that provides separate wine lists for red and white that look like copies of War and Peace?  Except that there are two wines per page, and they aren’t listed by country of origin, or varietal type – they’re listed by what someone (God knows who) thinks is the type.  Who would have guessed a Chianti Classico is a “full bodied red”?  Certainly no one who knows wine.  In any normal restaurant this wine list would run maybe 6 or 7 pages at the most.  Apparently wines by the glass are a state secret, you have to ask if they have them.   

Rubbery, overcooked octopus, brittle fried pumpkin flowers, devoid of taste, topped with cold ricotta, a filet that could only be described as a low-end USDA Choice from a chain steakhouse in the US, also rubbery and tasteless.  At least the fish was cooked properly, but was lying on a hockey puck of warm wilted spinach.

Appallingly bad service, one hour to get the appetizer.  They seem to be totally confused about everything.    And 160 euros for the experience.  There is a traditional Italian restaurant about two doors up that was packed.  Ad Hoc wasn’t.  I can see why."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Emperors New Clothes,May 2018 •,"Nice atmosphere and the staff were attentive but after that not a lot more to say. I hope you have heard the story of ‘The Emperors New Clothes’. Everyone saying how great everything is but in truth the food is very mediocre. Perhaps we went on a wrong night. Who knows?

The food was bland and the wine was very average. The wine served was just a normal run of the mill, nothing special. Have tasted a lot better for a lot less."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Too touristic,Feb 2018 •,"An ambitious restaurant in Rome’s downtown without a real soul; menù is a mixed of meat and fish but without a real specialization
Our impression is that the place is too touristic not a real gourmet high quality experience
Service appropriate"
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Forget truffle Carbonara,May 2017 •,Truffle menu is nice to try but Carbonara was over cooked  and a bit messy to eat. Meat with  truffle could be softer. Desert not the best option. Service was ok and also the wine menu
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,One of the worst meals of my life,Feb 2017 •,"Service is fine, decor fine, but the food is extremely bad, almost inedible. Extremely disappointing. The wine list good, but that's it."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,2 hours of disappointment,Aug 2017 •,"Came here based off of TripAdvisor reviews and I'm debating deleting the app as it's clear the people who rate this place highly are delusional.

I'll start by saying that the hospitality and staff was amongst the best I received during my 10 stop Italian tour. The free glass of wine, the free pre desert and the free bottle of house olive oil was appreciated and the staff were excellent in every way especially the bald waiter with the blue eyes who was amazing at his job but the food was total crap!

We each got the black truffle tasting menu, it was our last night so we decided to splash out a bit and the table behind us (an American family) also got the black truffle tasting menu. The starters were ok. 2 of them were the same but one had basil and the beef tartar was bland.

The truffle carbonara was very nice, but the spaghetti dish was average. The ox cheek was tough with a sirloin type fat down one side. At this time the table behind us got a steak and we noticed them complaining that it was tough so it wasn't just us. For this reason I believe the meat to be poorly sourced. The duck however was decent.

The deserts were all crap, we actually didn't finish them. Meanwhile the Americans on the table behind us were blown away by the same dishes we disliked which leads me to believe that the reviews of this place are mostly by Americans ""visiting Europe"". 

I never know which reviews to trust so if you're reading this take the opinion of someone who has eaten at Michelin star restaurants around the world and has a knack for finding hidden gems, this place, in a nut shell, the food is below average with truffle on top. The service and hospitality is excellent but you can't eat good service. Presentation was also excellent, however id say avoid this place."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Just so so and bland,Jul 2017 •,"Had the truffle tasting and it tasted flat. Definitely expensive. Even for the type of upscale restaurant that it tries to be, it's expensive for the quality of the food."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Regrettable food-- cold pasta carbonara in Rome,Jun 2017 •,"I don't write negative reviews. I'd rather say nothing because everybody can have an off night and I've worked in food and know how tough it can be. But one thing out of several missteps prompted me to write this. I hope I save someone who really wants to experience good Roman food from disappointment (and it's not hard to find good food in Rome!).  First, this is tourist food; upscale to be sure. The focus on truffles is not really representative of Roman cuisine (if that's what you what).  You can get that type of menu in many upscale hotels in many places. I could tolerate that--it is what it is-- had our food been served appropriately.I went for the Roman menu hoping for tradition and creativity to meet well. My partner went for the land menu. Both suffered the same problem.  Some of this food was cooked way ahead. That can be done with some things but not others. Dishes that should have been hot were served cold. I'm talking cold gummy pasta carbonara, people! Another dish--intended to be hot- was warm in one part and not just cold but ice cold in another. That is just not excusable. Service this evening was also chaotic, but I felt bad for the 3 young women who were dealing with some 8-10 top  tourist groups and only one of them seemed to be a professional server. I've been coming to Rome for 30 years and I have NEVER experienced anything like this. We decided to pay and leave after the pasta debacle (I actually sent it back and waited 45 minutes for the server to return with a replacement--never happened), even though we weren't halfway through the fixed menu. The poor server was very apologetic and refused to let us pay. I'm hoping this was a problematic evening and won't occur again, although I'm pretty sure much of the food is made too far ahead (fried foods much be served subito-- the fritti were lukewarm going on cold) or the food isn't getting from kitchen to table promptly. I should have known better, but I trusted reviews and even recommendations from travel advisors I know. If you are planning for this to be your splurge in Rome, you might think twice about it. My advice: go simple in Rome; it's almost always good if not great."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Far behind expectations - what did we miss?,Jun 2017 •,"After several recommendations, and a quick read through on TA feedbacks - we booked Ad Hoc for our last night in Rome. We are both global travelers, and we know a good restaurant from a great. This ended up as neither of the two.
We arrived with expectations, and our expectations were raised even further after being escorted to our table. The interior is inviting - with romantic seating and wine bottles covering the wall from floor to ceiling. Prosecco as a complimentary aperitif is never wrong either.
We received the menu, and decided to go with the truffle tasting menu - despite being slightly off season. We went with full wine pairing, and from here and out our expectations were thrown off a cliff...
The one thing that surprised us the most, was the constant waiting(which we could easily notice being a distraction for the tables next to us as well) There was an extreme amount of dead time between the courses, and this is where we found the wine pairing to be a mistake. The wines offered as part of the wine package were well balanced with the courses served, but in small servings. With 30 minutes to the next course, and with no offers for a refill or other supplementary drinks. Weird!
Food? Started off well with a variety of starters. Cheese, deep fried veggies and truffles as front runners - the starter was heavy...but rather pleasant. Last one on the plate was a beef tartare. Unseasoned, as they felt we should season by taste ourselves... What???
Pasta course was a duo of pastas. Both creamy and cheesy and heavy - loaded with truffle shavings. I'd loved it if this was the only heavy course, but already by now - the meal is loosing balance. There are no vegetables, and no acidity to balance the weight of cream/cheese/truffles.
Main course. Duck breast and beef cheek loaded with truffles. Duck breast - cold and rubbery. Beef cheek - cold and tasteless(salty if anything at all) We sent it back, and started to loose patience.
Decided to wait for desserts. All good, but guess what - all creamy and heavy! A fresh sorbet could have saved half the day, but was unfortunately not part of the game.
All in all - I can only recommend the wines served(although served in a strange way...bottles were never brought to the table?)
We had the main courses removed from our bill - which helped on our mood...although I took that more or less for granted.
Sorry to say - this experience is no where near our top 10 in Rome..."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Missed the mark,May 2017 •,"Friendly, welcoming staff. Nicely designed restaurant. Superb wine list. Quiet atmosphere. Food presentation beautiful.  So what went wrong......the food was just average and lukewarm. I thought there would be some kind of dress code but I guess there is no such thing these days! Then waited a very long time for the check."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Won't be going back,May 2017 •,"Let me start with the positives. The wine list is fantastic all regions of Italy are represented and many level price points will satisfy any oenophile. The food presentation is nice, but was lacking in taste and my food was not hot. My fiore di zucca was cold,beef tartare tasteless, homemade spaghetti with duck ragout cold,gnocchi dish ok. A pork dish ok but not hot. Passed on desserts. We then waited for 20 minutes for a check. The owner was very kind and gave us olive oil and a bottle of wine gratis. Also you would expect people to be dressed properly, shorts on a Sunday night come on. This is not a fine dinning restaurant."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Humiliating disappointing bad experience,May 2017 •,We were excited given the good reviews for this restaurant but the food was an attempt to produce something creative and special but they failed miserably.  The food has no taste.  Tried both the land and sea tasting menus.  Really frustrating when the service is soooo slow to have to wait for long between courses and have one flop after the other being served.  The staff act like they are serving exquisite dishes and take too much time explaining and make you wait forever which makes the whole experience even more worse.  The locale has character since you are sitting in the middle of a wine cellar but once you start the experience you realize that it is not authentic at all.   When we expressed concern over the slow service they became defensive and then offensive.  showing no respect and condescendence to customers.   Do not recommend at all.
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Rip-off in Ripetta street: the most over-rated restaurant ever.,Jan 2017 •,"We (my wife, my son and I) had a terrible experience in ad-hoc on Thursday 5 January 2017. It is a miracle that this restaurant is in the Roma top 100 with such poor food, atmosphere, attitude, service, organisation, heating, etc...Only the wine was good. We had far far far better experiences during our stay in Roma, including at Babette, which is in the same area.
We booked by phone the day before for three and arrived on time at 800pm. We were seated in the room on the right side when you enter the restaurant and we felt immediatly uncomfortable with the temperature of the room despite a very visible (and working) heating system. There were permanent flows of cold and hot airs in the room. We complained to the head waitress (the boss?) who said they have a problem with the door (in fact, even when the door was completly closed, the issue with the temperature was more or less the same) and said she will do her best to move us to another table. This did not happen despite a table that we could see became available at some stage and stayed free for may be 30 minutes. At the end of the dinner (during which my wife kept her coat...) we asked why she did not move us to the other table and she said (believe it or not): ""because it is a table for four and you are only three""....translation: i do not care about your health but i care about making money even if i have to over-promise for this.
Generally speaking we found that the head waitress (the boss?) overpromised on everything during this dinner...and under-delivered.
Regarding food, the truffle experience was expensive and disappointing. We would rate the food somewhere between ""nothing special"" for the pasta and ""bad"" for the duck which was served dry when we asked medium rare. We noticed that people at the table next to us complained about the beef.
The Tuscany red wine was good...but do you need to introduce it with tons of words and superlatives as you would do for a Chateau Petrus 1982?
The service was very very long...it took one hour to get the first course and then another hour to get the second one and nothing seemed really properly organised and managed.
When we decided to stop the experience before the dessert and asked for the bill, the head waitress (the boss?) asked about our feeling. We told us exactly what was our view: big problem with the temperature, no transfer to the other table when it was available, nothing special (at best) with the food and good wine. She said several times she was confused but did not seem to be so confused...More a bad actress than a good head waitress (or a boss?).
The bill included a 10% discount which seems to be applicable when you make an internet booking...but we realized after we left the restaurant that our first courses were charged at €30 vs €25. Based on other reviews, we believe it is because the black trufle was partly replaced by white trufle. This was our choice but when this option was proposed by the waitress she never mentioned we have to pay an extra for this.
Finally, when we asked for our coats, a waitress gave us a probably very expensive Moncler down jacket...which was not belonging to us. Imagine what could have happened with clients less honest than we are...Don't go there with expensive coats!
Never again! and FYI we are used to go to all sort of restaurants privately or because of our jobs, from small local restaurants to 3* Michelin restaurants (see our other reviews) and we believe we are able to make the difference between good and bad food, good and bad service, etc..."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Dinner,Jan 2017 •,"It Was Very expensive for the bad cooking, certainly an overestimated place, the environment Was nice but the people Was Very mean un the service."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,pas terrible,May 2016 •,we reserved for the birthday of my mother and we were disappointed. it may be good for young couple but not for family. main dish is too salty and the desert is too sweet.
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Too much fuss for nothing,Oct 2016 •,"We were so disappointed from this place that we have to write a review in order to protect tourists being trapped in the future and spending their money here! The food is rather average, nothing too noteworthy, prices are sky high (35€ for an average beef with some black truffle) and the choice really limited, you have to choose the menu at 79€ with wine but NO truffles for this one! The place is advertised as the truffle paradise but in order to have any truffle dish, you have to spend more than 75€ per person and to be honest the tastes don't worth it."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Disappointing dinner,Oct 2016 •,"This restaurant was recommended to us by two different people and while they must have had a good experience, we did not. 

It took 30 minutes to get our order taken. The server did apologize for the delay but the incredibly slow pace continued. 

45 minutes into our visit, we received bread. 1/2 of the bread was very dry and without much taste/flavour. 

On two occasions the server said our dinner would be coming right away but it never did. It took almost 3 hours before the main course was served. My husband ordered the Sea Tasting Menu and I had the Land Tasting Menu.  We both found the food to be excessively salty and very average overall.

Against our better judgement, we decided to order dessert. The tiramisu was too soupy/soggy and was probably the worst I have ever had.

The server never offered to refill our beverages and never asked if we were enjoying our meal. They ignored us for most of the evening. 

While the bathroom was clean there were no hand towels at all. 

It then took us a very long time to get the bill because the servers continued to avoid us.

We arrived for dinner at 8pm and left at 11:45pm. Unbelievably long dinner for food that was less than good for the price we paid. 

We definitely do not recommend this restaurant."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Wish we had gone some place else for special occasion,Aug 2016 •,"I really wanted to like this place, we had our 10 year anniversary in Rome and after I found out my first choice was closed for the summer holidays, we decided this would be perfect. 
Now we were a party of 4, 2 ordered the Truffle tasting menu, one the land menu and the other they created a truffle tasting menu for vegetarians, all with matching wines... bill came to 420 odd Euros...so wasn't a cheap meal but nor was is great...

Firstly and perhaps those that don't order the truffles will get a better experience but I found the menu to be unimaginative and merely they just put slices of truffle on everything. It started with being presented with a small table spoon of cold mash potato, compliments of the chef they said...um ok wasn't particularly tasty I left half of mine. 
then came the tasting plate, this was perhaps the nicest of all the dishes, a plate segmented into 3 with a cold battered pumpkin flower, a burrata, and the poorest excuse of steak tartar I have ever seen. simply a square of raw mince and 3 slices of truffle, no capers, nothing else. 
the pasta was presented , two of them , however they tasted exactly the same...i liked them but wondered why you would put two of essentially the same pasta of the same plate... this was also an issue as the pasta was on this silly little plate and whilst eating one side the other got cold so again that wasn't very nice.
Next the mains...2 tiny slices of dry over cooked duck breast with sliced truffle, on what appeared to be the same cold potato we got at the start, and a beef cheek thing, which was nice, but some what confused in the whole tasting menu...

You did however get a very good amount of truffles...this I can't fault them of... I however would recommend that people don't do the tasting menu, rather order from the main menu and perhaps order an item or 2 with truffles..

Finally we had what will perhaps be the worst Tiramisu I have every ordered, it tasted like it was one layer of biscuit and then they got some of the whipped cream in a can and sprayed on top....not nice, maybe at the Cheese cake factory but not at a decent restaurant.

Now the final and somewhat laughable moment, some of our group wanted to buy fresh truffles, they went to the back and were presented with fresh black truffles ....how much we ask ...600 euro a kilo....umm no
Next morning we go to Campo Di Fiori ask the vendor who talks to a guy, price 180 euro a kilo.....

So in short no I wouldn't recommend dining here, glad we caught up with our friends, just wish it was a better meal. I am sure my experience won't stop people from attending, and perhaps we  ordered poorly, I just didn't like it for the reasons given above."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Too highly rated,Jul 2016 •,We had dinner in this place in July. Food quality was clealy lower than many other places in Rome with similar ranking. Absolute disaster was the 'alternative' Tiramisu'. A cookie with some chocolate and a mountain of whipped cream.
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Mr Gennadiy,Jul 2016 •,Shortly....the food is pretty average. The price was 111 euro for 1 person. Left hungry. All did just for appearance. Not worth to visit at all.
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Disappointing on our final night in Rome,May 2016 •,"We had booked our table at Ad Hoc some time in advance of our trip to Rome and decided we would keep it as our final night treat. We were invited to the pre-meal truffle tasting which was a nice touch and this started our evening off well with a free glass of prosecco to go with it. First impressions were good at the restaurant with another free glass of prosecco as we perused the menu. The wine list was extensive but there were choices for all palates and budgets, and we were very happy with our choice. Unfortunately that's where our positive experiences ended. We were left feeling very underwhelmed with the food when it arrived - whilst it looked good visually it simply lacked in taste. My pasta dish was nice but steak for main was cold on arrival. My girlfriend chose a truffle pasta that was far from impressive (and it should have been for the price!) and she couldn't eat the suckling pork chosen for mains - it came with no accompaniments meaning you had simply 2 big bits of meat on a plate). The staff offered to get an alternative as we didn't like the pork, but we had lost faith and decided against it. For the same reason we chose not to get dessert. The restaurant knocked off half the cost of the pork main from our bill, which was appreciated, but honestly we'd rather have paid full price and enjoyed our meal. After having high hopes it feels like the restaurant is a little style over substance. With sadness, this was a very disappointing end to our trip. It says something when you're happier with your gelato on the way home..."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Bad experience....,Jun 2016 •,"So many good reviews and still, yesterday night was a great disappointment. 
Service was slow, starters were good. 
Octopus was stiff and nor eatable ( but that changed us without any blink of an eye). 
Spaghetti with lobster wish very good.
Main dishes, that is the main issue.....
After one hour that we waited for our beef dish
And no one came over, we called the manager and she was sorry for not letting us no that "" their was a problem in the kitchen ""......
Another few minutes past and finely the under cook dishy came. 
We didn't eat those dishes, we paid the bill and live."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Minority Report,Feb 2016 •,"For restaurants as highly regarded as Ad Hoc, the majority of Tripadvisor reviews gush with unbridled delight, while a tiny minority will tell you it's all hype and a waste of money. Sadly, this time I have to side with the naysayers. 

There were three of us. Two ordered tasting menus paired with wines; one ordered a la cart. The consensus: no interesting flavors in anything we tried, salt being the dominant (and only clearly discernible) one. We did not complain, but it felt like the staff knew the kitchen was underperforming; everyone around was plied with multiple freebies. We received complimentary sparkling wine with a pre-appetizer, a pre-desert and a post-desert, an extra desert wine and a take home bag of goodies. The restaurant is very cute, has a nice vibe, and an interesting sounding menu that offers creative alternatives to traditional Roman food. It has an impressive wine collection and accommodating staff. It could have been a wonderful place—if it served good food. 

The cranky naysayers are prone to utter things like: ""It was the worst meal we had in ... "" Unfortunately, even this unkind sentence applies to our experience as well. During our 5-day Roman holiday, it was the worst meal we had. That is even taking into account that some of our meals were totally un-fancy, like a salmon sandwich served on a paper plate. But it was a pretty damn tasty sandwich. Since it is impossible to build a great reputation by serving mediocre food, I conclude that Ad Hoc had better days. In view of that, I don't know how to interpret our experience. Exploiting old, but now badly faded glory? Having a really bad day? The chef quit in the morning? Well, I won't find out, since a return visit is rather unlikely."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,very dissapointing,Mar 2016 •,"After being in so many cities and restaurants i was expecting something else. I have no idea how this place got such good reviews. We got the truffles menue, the pairing wine was bad, the food was cold and the service was slow. Really bad place, for tourist who don't know much about food in general."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Huge Disappointment,Dec 2015 •,"I booked this restaurant in advance for my boyfriends birthday after reading the amazing  reviews on TA and was so disappointed that I felt compelled to share my own experience of the tasting menu. To begin, the menus were missing a number of items one of which was a seared duck salad that was substituted with a cheese salad. Not a suitable replacement. Additionally there was only one type of truffle available which meant we didnt opt for this tasting menu. All of the food itself was bland and lacked seasoning with the exception of the pasta course and a number of dishes were cooked terribly. The beef cheek for example was like chewing leather despite being such a tender cut of meat. The service was also awful, with one of the waitresses contstantly slamming down our dishes and having a serious attitude problem. The only saving grace about this place is that the wines are fantastic and are very reasonably priced alongside the tasting menu. I would not return however for this alone and would head on down to Trastevere where the food is exceptional and a fraction of the price."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Don't waste your money on expensive plates. Just drink some wine.,Dec 2015 •,"I went with my wife and I was very excited to spend money on a rare and tasty dinner. We ordered beef fillet and honey duck with black truffels. The result... LOW QUANTITY AND QUALITY AT A VERY HIGH PRICE!!! 
However the variety of wine available was large."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Our table was cancelled on short notice,Dec 2015 •,"Our table reservation for my birthday dinner at ad hoc's table 28 got canceled on short notice without any credible reason.  The reservation included a private wine and truffle tasting.  Ad hoc offered us the tasting menu in the restaurant as a replacement which is nice but the setting clearly not comparable with table 28.  What a disappointment!

We had a very nice truffle and lobster dinner at Radina, which our hotel was fortunately able to arrange on very short notice."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Music was nice,Dec 2015 •,"Just left this place and for sure won't never try again. The best part of the dinner was the lounge music! They present themselves like a sophisticated and gourmet restaurant, but I had much better experience in Rome...and at better price. Took starter, honestly quite nice, but with a kind of basket made of parmesan that probably should be more crispy than what it was: tasty, but so hard to eat that I thought it was prepared too much in advance. Then I took tonnarelli with truffle: they said ""Black Norcia truffle"", but no taste! Maybe not fresh? Or maybe just ""nero pregiato"" or some kind of second class truffle like that? 
Don't need to know, cause for sure I won't repeat ever same mistake"
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,So disappointing it hearts...,Nov 2015 •,"We ended up here after reading very good reviews on Trip Advisor but our dinner was an experience of tasteless disappointing food.
After we were seated we had to wait about 10 minutes until we were approached and handed over the menus. 
For first course we ordered a home made smoked salmon and pumpkin flowers. The salmon dish was BAD. It was placed on tasteless anemic small cubes of potatoes and carrots and on top if it was a yogurt sauce. The pumpkin flowers were served deep fried with the same yogurt sauce - very very BAD dish. We left most of the food on the plat but the waitress didn't even wondered why.
For the mains we ordered truffle dishes. A polenta with truffles and truffled pasta.
The polenta was tasteless. It was made out of corn flower and not from a fresh corn. The result was s mushy unpleasant chunk of corn flower purée.
The pasta was surprisingly good and it was the only food we completed eating.
After clearing the table from the main courses we had to wait 15-20 minutes for a waitress to approach us. After loosing hope to get someone's attention, we gave up desert and ask for the bill.
The only positive element at this place was the wide selection of wines they offer, unfortunately, it doesn't come with  a sommelier to assist the dinners. 
Overall it was a a very disappointing experience and the high rating the place is an unexplainable mystery."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Not my taste,Oct 2015 •,"Hard to review restaurants - everyone has a different palate. The service and presentation at Ad Hoc was beautiful, and the wine choices were excellent, but the food was just not to my taste. A little too heavy on the truffles for me."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Underwhelming,Sept 2015 •,"Firstly I'd just like to stress how excellent the staff were, very friendly,  great english and excellent at helping you pick a wine to your tastes.  However the food was really unimpressive especially considering the cost, 130 euros for antipasti, first and second courses and a bottle of wine, we didn't want to take the chance with dessert. The antipasti were the best part of the meal and everything else suffered from pretty big cooking errors that you wouldn't expect at an establishment of this calibre,  such as splitting the eggs for the carbonara so it was basically pasta stuck together solidly by scrambled eggs. Complimentary truffle tasting and bottle of sparkling wine were nice. Overall I would advise anyone visiting Rome to save your money and give this a miss, there are too many other good restaurants in Rome, many for around half the price with much better food."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,POOR SERVICE. Great atmosphere. Ok food,Aug 2015 •,"Can't understand it is number two of the pricey restaurants of Trip Advisor. I am nearly never disappointed! DON'T GO THERE.
The atmosphere is great. they serve you a cheap prosecco on the house. I could not drink it. Then you get the bottle home, a good detail, useless if the wine is poor. Service (the lady in the right was poor. Nervous, speedy, rushing. If we needed service, they suddenly would not hear. They pushed the tasting menus. We did not go for that. Tension when speaking to them. Tension between them (you might see it from the picture. The last thing you wanton holiday. Not a good tip from TripAdvisor"
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Last Dinner in Rome. What a terrible choice.,Mar 2015 •,"We were in Rome for a few days for the wedding of our friends, and we booked for Ad Hoc because of my love for truffles. I thought it would be the best way to end the trip - I was wrong.

Cooking with truffles is not the same as sticking some truffle shavings on a dish. This restaurant believes on the later. Besides this (huge) issue, the service was slow, borderline rude and generally not in line with the prices of the menus.

The food itself was nothing more than average - every other meal we had in Rome was better - and I deeply regret visiting and above all convincing two of our friends to join us.

Food quality and service are a huge mismatch with the price. Would not visit again."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Disappointing,Jul 2015 •,"Our baseline for comparing ""fine dining"" restaurants while traveling is what we are used to in San Francisco where what we consider ""excellent"" would include the Slanted Door, Foreign Cinema, etc.
By that standard, Ad Hoc was a major disappointment.

Having enjoyed at Ciampini (above the Spanish Steps), on a previous evening, what was hands down the best duck breast I have ever had, I was looking for something at least as close in quality. So I tried duck breast at Ad Hoc and found it tough and pretty much tasteless (other than a truffle adornment). My spouse had veal stuffed rabbit which was mostly veal (dry ground meat) and little rabbit. 

Pasta with truffles and a sampler antipasti were good. But the main courses were just so sub par.

The wine selection was varied but I found the prices (at least of those wines with which I am familiar) to be high (even compared to other restaurants). There was no real sommelier and the waitress, despite knowing something about the wines they serve, had no knowledge of world wines like the California Pinot Noirs we were hoping to find a like offering for.

A well behaved toddler at an adjacent table eventually started to lose interest in remaining well behaved (as is reasonably expected) and that detracted as much from the fine dining experience as did the seating of male guests in shorts.  

Rounding out my unhappiness with Ad Hoc was the ""air conditioned"" temperature of 28 degrees Celsius, which is well into the high 80s F. It was almost as hot inside the restaurant as it was outside on a summer July evening in Rome.

We won't be going back."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Disappointed,Jul 2015 •,"It's our last night in Rome, found this highly rated restaurant from trip adviser, had high expectation for the last fine dining in Rome. The Gaja wine was excellent, the tasting starter plate was great, however, everything else was disappointing. Most dishes were too salty, not well presented as a top rate restaurant should be. I wonder how it gets such great reviews on trip adviser... Maybe the excellent rating raised our expectation so it's hard to exceed! I almost doubt if it's the same chef tonight that prepare dishes for us!"
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,"Slow, slow, slow....",May 2015 •,"This was our 3rd visit to Ad Hoc - and it will be the last one too.

We had booked a table at 8.00 p.m. a month in advance and requested a table in the room to the left without any comments from Ad Hoc. However on arrival we were shown to a table in the room to the right. When we denied we were then shown to a table in the room to the left.

However this was only the beginning of our troubles. We were seated, offered a glass of spumante - very nice - and had the menu. Then for more than 20 minutes nothing happened. Then our orders were taken.

I ordered the fish tasting menu and my husband the land tasting menu. Both with pairing wine menu.

Then we had an amuse and now we started waiting again. At appr. 9.00 our starters were served and at appr. 10.00 our pastas were served. 
My pasta was not hot, only lukewarm. When I mentioned it to the waitress she said ""she would tell the chef"". 
Also I found out that for the fish menu the 3 starters and the 2 pastas both included smoked salmon and octopus/squid - not very varied.

At 10.30 e.g. 2 ½ hour after our arrival there were still no sign of the main courses. I then asked when we could expect these and were told that these long waiting hours was normal and that customers normally liked this. and that many customers actually booked tables at 18.00 or 19.00 p.m. to go home before 11.00 p.m.

I then asked for the bill - otherwise we could have stayed until midnight.

Payed 70 EUR for to starters, to pastas and four glasses of wine and the ""free"" spumante.

The other 2 times we had been very satisfied but after this time we will NEVER return."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Great ambience but the food quality ???,Apr 2015 •,"Ad Hoc restaurant had a top 60 rating in Rome and our family did have some expectations of well cooked food and good service this evening.  30 minutes before we where invited to a complimentary truffle tasting in the restaurants truffle store. This was a very nice startup for the dinner and maybe our expectations increased a bit more after this.
We got a glass of complimentary sparkling wine upon arriving and soon after a small teaser of cheese-mousse which was great.
We had scallops and tartare for starters. The scallops where well over done but the beef tartar was fresh and good. As main course we had the sucking pig that was again well over done and dry, also it had very little taste, it came with light fried and crispy artichoke that tasted good. We also had ox cheek that was a bit to well done.
Im happy we didn't go for the truffle dishes on the menu (same dishes but double price and truffle). With a good bottle of Tignanello (95€) the meal was 253€. For that I would expect a lot better quality from the kitchen! 
The ambience is very nice and service good so its really sad that the kitchen didn't deliver.
Ofcourse I didnt expect michelin star class but this experience was just not okej, this is what you could expect from the cheapest osteria anywhere. I would not go there again."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Do not bother.,Feb 2022 •,"While the wine was excellent and the atmosphere nice the food was neither. In fact, it was actually bad. This restaurant is a definite no go!"
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Lack of service,Feb 2015 •,"Booked six weeks ago by my girlfriend as her parents had highly recommended it and was so excited about the taster menu. Confirmed again several weeks ago. Dressed for a nice occasion to mark the end of our holiday, arrived by taxi and the lights were out. Note on the door saying closed for planned refurbishment. Not hard to send an email informing us as it was a pain to find another restaurant serving the same quality of food at no notice. Real shame as the reviews are so good for this place, not great service for potential customers this time though."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Worst dining experience of my life!,Feb 2022 •,"****** DO NOT GO*******
I don't think I have ever been made to feel quite so invisible, unwanted and worthless in my life.
Can hardly find the words to describe just how terrible the service was at this restaurant.
Basically ignored by wait staff, left waiting, sneered at.
Ad Hoc there is no way that you deserve the position you have as one of Rome's top restaurants.
Absolutely appalling.
My experience was exactly the same as all the other ""terrible"" reviews. How a business can still be running with such a consistent level of poor customer service is beyond me!

*********VILE***********"
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,"Great staff, terrible food",Feb 2022 •,"The only reason I'm giving it a poor and not terrible is because the staff is wonderful, attentive, knowledgeable and lovely. The food is just not good. We went on our honeymoon and did the truffle tasting. Every course was dry, overcooked, under seasoned and sometimes plain inedible. I couldn't even cut the duck with my knife. The ""tiramisu"" in the dessert tasting was whipped cream over coffee grounds. And the ""creme brûlée"" was about a teaspoon of pudding under such an absurdly thick layer of uncooked suger. Just really not good. 

It's not cheap, 150 euro per person for the mixed truffle tasting with wine. Just really really disappointing. We don't complain at restaurants so we grinned and bared it but for that much money we're pretty damn pissed. 

The place is beautiful, and again staff is lovely. But the food was just terrible. And to be honest, it seems like a bit of a racket. You're paying for truffles and there was very little on each dish. So besides the dishes being poorly cooked, they didn't have much truffle on them. 

I feel bad even writing this review. We work in restaurants and I hate crapping on other chefs. But this was just too much. If the restaurant sees this, please note that your staff is excellent. At least there's that."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Stay away of it,Nov 2014 •,"We recently reserved for a family event and when we showed a rude girl at the door simply said they had given the table to other customers. We were 10' late (caught in the usual Roman traffic) but they didn't even think of calling us (why do they ask for the phone number?), just acted in the worst and least professional way. Happily the evening turned into a good one as we found a much better spot around there!"
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Dissapointing,Oct 2014 •,"Ambience is great, wine list very good.

Tasting menu was a selection of poor canapes, the ones that you have at really bad wedding receptions. Pig in a blanket type of bites.

Staff was ok but my server was not english or italian speaking....We didnt know what we were eating

I was shocked at the reviews I read....for 100 euro a person.....you expect something decent......how you can fail at pasta in Rome?"
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Not that kind of feeling,Jul 2014 •,"As we book by internet, and have the reply from them that there will be an event for tasting of truffle, just besides the main shop. I think that is quite a good starting and warm welcome. However, while arrive, the waiter told us it is another stall, not belong to them. We are told to walk 50 metres, however, there are a lot other restaurants nearby. And the worst is, it is raining. I just think they should lead me there, but in vain.

Food is okay, average. Wine was suggested to be the one next to me, just wonder if it is convenient for taking out, ha..."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Overpriced for subpar food,Feb 2022 •,"I saw the amazing reviews on TA so decided to book it for our first night in Rome.  To our dismay the food was terrible for my husband and average for me.  My husband likes lean beef and the waiter assured us it is lean meat.  It was so fatty he couldn't eat any of it. 
I ordered fish which was OK.  The meal was expensive and not impressive. 
Very disappointed.  Would Not recommend."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Bad service and mediocre food,Feb 2022 •,"Bad service, literally had to flag down the waiter multiple times to get another glass of wine. Serving champagne in a wine glass is also odd for such a ""nice restaurant"". My fiancé and I both ordered the 5 course degestution. By the time we got to the 3rd course I asked for the check. I didn't want to waste anymore time in this place nor eat the bland food that looked as if it had been sitting under a heat lamp. There are much better options in Rome."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Food in perfection but lack of service!,Feb 2022 •,Ristorante AdHoc in Rome brings out the best from the kitchen but with 2 few serving the rating goes down rapidly! I have never ever got the two first courses that fast but after that nothing..... We could not even order an espresso because the staff had to much work to do. This was our wedding dinner!!!
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Not worth your money!,May 2014 •,"We had read great reviews of Ad Hoc and I therefore booked a table long time in advance - as we were going to celebrate my mothers birthday. We had read that the restaurant had a dress code - so we dressed up. We visited the truffle tasting room - which was a pleasant experience with bubbles and truffles. The staff was also very Nice and professionell here. However, when we arrived at the restaurant we were greeted by a rather rude waiter!! And the restaurant did not seem to have a dress code at all - as there were guests in jeans, jeans jackets, shorts and also jogging suits?!! We ordered the land tasting meny with wine. The first course was rather ok and so was the pasta. The main course was not ok - it did not taste anything. I had also asked in advance if they could have a surprice for my mother - but the only thing she got was a candle on her dessert (which we had ordered already). The waiter continued to be rude out through the evening!! I would not recommend this restaurant!"
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Beyond Disappointing!,Apr 2014 •,"I recently arrived about five minutes early for a 9:30pm dinner reservation on a Saturday evening.  I had planned on doing the tasting menu as it was the last evening of my holiday.  The reviews on Trip Advisor were relatively positive, so this helped to drive my dining decision for that evening.

Upon arrival at the restaurant, there was no host or hostess at the door to greet customers.  I understand that service is quite lacking in Italy and not up to American standards, but a simple greeting is not much to expect.  I observed two rather haggard looking servers who were running around like chickens with their heads cut off as the restaurant was pretty full.

My guest and I were finally greeted by one of the servers who was a bit snarly.  She sat us at our table, which faced both the front door and the service station, so it really wasn't the best seat in the house.  I was disappointed, but there really was not anything that we could do about it.

We were presented with menus after about a 5 minute wait and then our server disappeared to assist with other tables.  After about 15 minutes, she came over and took our order, including our wine order.  But then disappeared.  Each time that we tried to flag her down, she just rolled her eyes at us and ran to assist the other server or other tables.

After another 10 minutes, she came back and informed us that the wine that we had ordered was no longer available.  I then proceeded to select another wine.  She then returned to the table 10 minutes later with the new bottle.  The appalling part is that she simply slammed the bottle down on the table and then ran off to assist another table without opening our wine.  I'm really not sure why, but her behavior was unprofessional and downright insulting.  

So now after 40 minutes of sitting at the table, we still had no wine or food.  This was probably some of the sloppiest and rudest service that I have ever experienced. This is not the way that we envisioned our last meal in Rome.  My guest and I ultimately decided to leave and find a restaurant that appreciated our business.  As such, we simply got up and left.  The funny part is that neither server even noticed that we were leaving or had left as they were too busy with other tables. 

Hopefully, if you're seeking out a fine dining experience, which should include superior service in addition to good food, I would suggest looking elsewhere.

You've been duly warned!"
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Left Unnoticed,Apr 2014 •,"We specifically went to this place after reading all the wonderful reviews here. It started out wonderfully with a truffle tasting in a private room with sparking wine. Unfortunately, what started out as an experience ended with us cutting off the meal early. 

We are a party of four and were the third table seated at our 6:30 reservation. We ordered a bottle of wine and appetizers. We had the pumpkin blossoms, the seafood sampler, and the cheese tasting. Everything was mediocre at best, but presented very nicely. Once the appetizer was cleared we finished our bottle of wine and had to wait 45 minutes before our pasta was brought to the table. Again this was mediocre at best, but displayed very nicely. 

The wait staff never came by to fill up water or ask we if wanted another bottle of wine. Finally they cleared the pasta and we set in to wait for our second course. A rabbit stuffed with spiced veal. Needless to say we never made it that far. At 9pm we had to get up and track the manager down, whom never once came over to check on us, and tell her we were done. 

The consolation was sending the head waitress over to offer a sparkling wine. For all the hype and the price you're paying, this was absolutely unacceptable and unenjoyable. We were very disappointed after all the high reviews here on trip advisor. 

Beware as the entire audience was foreigners and there was never a wait. A restaurant rated this highly should be reservation only."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Disappointed in TA - led me astray,Feb 2022 •,"Probably the most disappointed I've been in a restaurant strongly recommended by trip advisor! My two selections for a main course - rabbit and fish of the day were adequate - however portions were minimalist and rabbit was ground!My daughter's filet strips were, I believe, also ground and past due date! I know about aged beef, as my father raised angus, this had been hung WAY too long! Asked that my daughter's be taken back, which was done, but found it added to bill! Thankfully, upon my objection they removed it! I would never return to this restaurant and felt that I was mislead by trip advisor whom I continually proclaim to be priceline's arch rival! Maybe not so! I hope to not be disappointed again, as I may have to drop my allegiance to TA, as well as, my stock!"
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Would NOT recommend,Feb 2022 •,"My boyfriend and I visited the Ad Hoc restaurant on the second of our two night stay in Rome. We had read fantastic reviews and were really keen to go, we actually tired to book on our first evening to no avail, as it was fully booked. Having secured a table for our last night we were looking forward to a fantastic meal. We arrived and were greeted by a friendly-ish blonde lady (in a rather short skirt!) and were shown to our table. We were seated for at least 5 minutes, if not more, before anyone came over to offer us a menu/drink etc but were willing to overlook this because of the fantastic reputation. We finally had sight of a menu, not before being told that the prawns and cod were unavailable for the evening. We placed our order and thought all was well, until the waitress came over to confirm what my boyfriend had ordered because in her words she was 'confused': not something you expect when paying the prices they ask for. We were then served an apperetife by a different waitress and shown the wine list (finally!). The apperetife was lovely and we decided to order a bottle of Riesling wine to go with out food - not before having been told that they 'might not have it', due to a busy night the night before. Again, not what you would expect when paying through the nose for a gastronomic experience. After a long wait, our main courses finally arrived, although, sadly, all I could taste was an unhealthy level of salt over the main dish and the sides. We mentioned to the waitress after finishing our main courses that this was the case and she acknowledged this (having not checked our food and asked if we were ok the whole way through the meal). We were then left at our table for a fairly solid amount of time, during which we witnessed what was frankly a shocking display between two members of staff (curiously, both the staff members who had served us) engaging in a full blown argument which included raising voices in front of guests, slamming plates and menus and even resulted in the manager becoming involved. As an aside - the table next to us had ordered the taster menu and when their food arrived the waitress (the same one serving us) had to question the food she was serving them as she couldn't remember what it was and then proceeded to swap the plates round twice because she could not remember who had ordered what. We were then asked whether we would like a desert, to which we replied no and asked for the bill. We were then asked to come over to the window tables because the card machine would not work where we were sitting. Upon delivery of our bill, we were also issued with a feedback form, on which we commented that the food had been average and certainly not what you would expect for the price and the service had been terrible. The only saving grace of the evening was the bottle of sparkling wine which every female guest was given upon departure. We are a young couple in our mid twenties and are lucky enough to have eaten in some of the worlds best restaurants, we are not overly fussy but the service we received at Ad Hoc was absolutely disgraceful in terms of the way the staff were behaving in front of paying customers and we would absolutely not recommend this restaurant to anyone, we were offered no discount and the meal cost us €130. I urge you to think twice before you consider going for a meal here, not cheap and disappointingly average food but we could have overlooked this had the service been exceptional, which it certainly was not."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Most expensive pasta dish ever!!!,Dec 2013 •,"I went to this place to celebrate my birthday and had a big disappointment. I ordered the truffled gnocchi that cost 25 euros and the waitress said:_black or white truffle? So I said white, I don't even know why. The food was OK and when the bill came they charged me 45 euros for my plate!!! So when I complained they told me in front of everyone that I should know the white truffle is much more expensive that the others, even though the price wasn't anywhere. You can imagine the humiliation. I think any restaurant should know you don't offer something that will double the price of the dish without warning the costumer, only if you have bad intentions of over-charging it. Thank God for trip advisor and the power we have of telling our story so the same won't happen to other travellers."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Not good at all,Nov 2013 •,"It is a mystery to us where all these excellent reviews come from, because this is for sure not one of the best restaurants in rome. It is definitely nothing special, with things on their card that are not in season, and fish i.e. tuna being served that is past its date. We would for sure not go back and not really recommend this restaurant either. Also the service was not great, the waitresses were friendly but slow."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Wannabe,Feb 2022 •,"It's as though the chef has watched a few too many reality tv cooking shows and thinks he can replicate. Unfortunately, the quality falls far short of Gordon Ramsey! 

Decent wine selection, but the food is not very good at all... A fancy swoosh of some colourful yet indiscernible liquid does not elevate the meal to 'fine dining'!!"
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,"deceptive,crooks and rude manager",Sept 2013 •,"the waitress said that the dish contained cherry tomato juice and not cherry tomatoes as stated in the menu.She said that they would put cherry tomatoes at no extra cost .subsequently she forgot about me and proceeded to argue with me about what she said.
the manager did not help and could not care . These are horrible people to give your money . please go to other restaurants where there are less crooks. horrible,horrible,horrible people,especially the manager!"
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Average at best,Sept 2013 •,"Let me start by saying that I don't eat to live but live to eat! I chose this restaurant based on the raving reviews.  Well what a dissapointment. It was not a disaster but is was below average. The restaurant does have a very nice decor and ambience, nice jazzy lounge music (the same cd played in loop all evening, hearing the songs 3 times). The young attractive hostesses were nice but do not know anything about food or wine.
 We chose the Sea tasting menu with wine pairing. Instead of pouring the wine at the table, they bring you your glass and tell you what it is. The first wine, supposedly a Chardonay was terrible so I asked to see the bottle. They brought me a bottle that was not open and told me that was the wine. I asked if they could bring us the bottles from there on, they did not. I asked to swith the Rose wine with a Red to go with the pasta, which they did, but it was just the wrong type of red for this, maybe my faut. A couple of the dish we had were good, lobster pasta and the baby squid. The rest was ok or below average. I had asked to switch the creme brule deserts with the other two, which agreed and aknowledged but they brought us the creme brules anyway. 
 Everything about this restaurant is like presuming to be something they are not, everything is superficial. No reputable restaurant gives 10% off for booking online and thta alone should have been my flag. I have a hard time understanding how people can write that this is the best restaurant they have eaten in in their life. We spent 12 days in Italy ad this was by far our worst experience in Rome,I was more angry at wasting my time than the money!  Try Il Gabriello, that wowed us, try the seefood ravioli and the seafood pasta."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Worst dining experience ever,Sept 2013 •,"We were looking forward to this restaurant, but it turned out to be a total disaster. We had to wait at least 40 minutes between each course, and the food was terrible. Only the buffalo cheese in the starter was Ok, everything else from our tasting menu was horrible. Both the taste and texture was the worst I have ever experienced in a restaurant. Service was Ok, but very slow, we had to wait for 10 minutes for water, and 20 minutes for the bill, they seem to ignore the first time you asked, and only acts on the second time. We find everyone dined there speaks English, which is not a good sign for a restaurant in Rome. Two tasting menu plus wines and a stater cost 155 euro, spend your money elsewhere and you can get much better food for 50 euro for 2 people."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Everything about this place was disappointing.,Aug 2013 •,"We were really looking forward to our meal here, and had made reservations by email online before we even got to Rome for the weekend. 

I don't usually take time to write negative reviews but really felt that I had to in this instance. 

The decor of the restaurant was very nice, but I'm afraid that's as far as compliments for this place stretch. 

The waitresses were very immature and didn't seem to know anything about the menu. Either that or they just couldn't be bothered to explain anything to us. We placed our order and were not served our starter for 45 mins. It then took ANOTHER HOUR (I kid you not) to be served our mains. 

I ordered the smoked salmon pasta which was hard and actually inedible. I picked out the salmon and just sent it back without asking for a replacement, or refund before you ask. The whole dish was just a disaster. Quite frankly, my 7 year old can cook a better pasta dish than that which was served to me that evening. The pasta course alone was £15. 

The started, I can't remember what it was meant to be but it was heavy and greasy- possibly courgette flowers, I don't recall. 

I ordered the 2-spilt mains and chose the catch of the day and tuna. They were both terrible. Really, I might as well have been in Bella Italia in Croydon for the quality of the food. 

By the time we finished our first three courses it was nearly 11.30pm. By this point we were so tired and irritated by the poor service and poor food that we decided not to stay for dessert. Possibly the best decision I made during my weekend in Rome. 

£115 for 3 courses, not inc dessert or wine. 

Less bothered am I about the £115 that I won't get back as the 2 and a half hours of my life spent dining there that could have been spent enjoying a meal elsewhere."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,What a joke,Aug 2013 •,We had holiday and we were eating in different good restaurants in rome. Visit in ad hoc was totally under our expections. We waited for long time all the time and service had huge problems. Whit food they just tried to do it way too complicated (less is more). Truffes ok everything else more or less horrible.
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Ad Hoc...Ad Nauseam!,Jul 2013 •,"We chose this restaurant because Trip Advisor ranked it among the top (#8 of 5922) restaurants in Rome, Italy. 

On our first attempt, we were told that because we had no reservations we could not dine there that night. The following day we made the reservation and we got a table for two. The restaurant was not busy that night. The space was ample where we were seated so I re-arranged my seat in order that I will be seated next to my wife and not across from her as we had always done in other restaurants. One of the hostesses approached us and told me that I should not move my chair from the original arrangement and did not elaborate further. I was quite surprised because we had never experienced this policy and besides they did not offer to seat us together in another table, as there were many empty tables that night. Because of this event, we were made to feel as “unwanted” patrons.

It took another 20-30 minutes before we were asked about our orders. We also had to request for a wine list as we were not provided a list with the menu. When we asked we were told by the server, “Oh, you want a glass of wine?” “What kind? We again asked that we please be provided with the wine list.

We ordered: a bottle of red wine; “ad hoc” pumpkin flowers for starters; flat spaghetti with baby squid for our pasta; and sea bass fillet, for our main course. Except for the “ad hoc”pumpkin flowers, which were quite good, the rest of the food were not out of the ordinary and quite saltier than what we would have preferred. Furthermore, throughout our dinner, we had to repeatedly request for attendance to our dining needs including extra  utensils, water, and even pepper.

The ambiance of this place was replete with the plasticity of protocol demonstrated by the entire staff which detracted from the “Italian warm hospitality” we expected. We felt that we and others just trying to have a good culinary experience should not be treated this way. At the “Ad Hoc, we had an “Ad Nauseam”Experience."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,The most fundamental of cooking mistakes!!!,Jun 2013 •,"I have to say that I had great expectations from this restaurant. I am always disappointed from the offer of estaurant in Rome: tradiational ones are boring, most expensive one often disappointing (a part from Il Pagliaccio, but it is ineed expensive). The worst restaurant in the world is in Rome (Convivio Troiani...). So, an acceptably priced, good level restaurant is sorely missed. Well, Ad hoc did not fill the gap. I had the gastronomy menu, to try their best effort. With wines... Lets start with the good things: some starters were good (courgette flowers, tartare's...) and the wines offered with the menu are really good. Than, the sore point: salt and some average cooking in the pasta and main dishes. Come on, the spaghetti in the parmigiano nest are trivial from one side, and a concentrate of salt from the other. A lot of the dishes were far too salty. The mains were not exciting, nothing really to lift them from a honest average. Not what I was looking for. Just a bad night? No sure....."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,A must miss,Jun 2013 •,"This was supposed to be our big splurge in Rome. 
We were looking forward to our meal at Ad Hoc with great enthusiasm, and when I told my wife they had a Truffles tasting menu, her eyes glazed over. 
When we arrived, we were seated directly across from where the servers picked up their food orders, even though the restaurant was nowhere near full. They then moved us to a table that was perhaps 12"" further removed from the food station.
They later moved us to another room that had only two other tables occupied at the time. Why they did not seat us there from the outset, I have no logical answer.
After looking over the menu, 
we ordered a bottle of red wine from Sicily. When I asked to have it decanted to help it breathe, the server said decanting was unnecessary,
and was steadfast in refusing my request. This was a first for any place I have ever at.
When we we served our entrees, the side dish of risotto and truffles was cold. Midway through the entree, the server came back to ask how the meal was, and I commented that ""the beef was good."" And though it was plainly evident that there was only a forkful sampled from the risotto, the server never bothered to make an inquiry.
Though I have an almost insatiable sweet tooth, we did not even look at the dessert menu.
At that point, we wanted to leave as quickly as possible,
but that was a challenge as well. After waiting 20 minutes for the check, I got up from the table to ask a different server for our check.
I waited a week before writing about this experience, hoping that time would lessen its sting.
It has not.
If however, you are looking for an expensive meal where the attitude is that diners should feel fortunate that they have been allowed to spend a copious amount for a meal, then Ad Hoc in Rome may be your kind of place."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,"Terrible, arrogant service!",Jun 2013 •,"Our family was anticipating a wonderdul dinner on our final night in Rome. Despite a reservation made and confirmed by our hotel, on May 25, 2013, we were rudely turned away at the door and told our reservation did not exist!  I even showed the hostess the e-mail from the hotel confirming our reservation, but she kept us waiting for 10 minutes while she ""checked"" the e-mail address of the hotel.  No apologies, no attempt to seat us despite many empty tables at the time.  We were told they were booked for the next 10 days and to return....really?our vacation is over tomorrow."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,"Not thrilled to be an outlier, but here is why we didn't like the restaurant",Mar 2013 •,"I am going to start this review by saying that I can not blame the restaurant completely.  We showed up  late for our already late reservation, and I think that the staff was not thrilled that we had shown up in the first place. But the situation quickly devolved from there.

My biggest negative  about the place may have been the mistranslations of the menu.  We were given English menus with Italian, which I can't argue against, but the translations were so bad that what we ordered and what we received were more than a little different.  For example, my older son ordered a beef filet.  What arrived was ground veal cheek with raisins and pine nuts. Which is what the Italian menu says it is.  They were nice about it and refunded our money,  but, for a place that clearly was full of British tourists, it seemed to be a major mistake.  An English menu item for suckling pig ended up being a rolled sausage of some form.  Since many of the reviewers had either a tasting menu or truffle pasta they may not have noted this but if you go ala carte its important. 

My wife had ordered the truffle pasta.  This was fine, but she originally received another pasta.  They did correct this error.  

Regardless of the menu descriptions, many of the dishes suffered from the ""one ingredient too many syndrome.""  

Other negatives may have been more temporary.  The restaurant was stuffy and hot.  Although our server was nice, the woman who appeared to be functioning as the head server was not.  I don't think she saw me watching her as she made a ""tongue out of the mouth"" face while gesturing with her eyes at our table.  Nice.

I do know that we our outliers in terms of what we think about this place and I do know that we were not completely innocent guests as we were 25' late for our table.  But I can not remember a less pleasant overall dinner experience in quite some time."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,"over-rated by tourists, not locals.",Mar 2013 •,"I booked through my hotel who told me that it was hard to get a table as they were always full, but managed to get a table last night. 

The first, terrible impression were that the wines were over priced : the bottle I wanted they were charging 50 percent more than the restaurant (near the colosseum) I went to the previous night. Secondly there were no locals eating there - another warning sign.

Then they brought the grissini which were soft when I bit into them, and the bread was stale. After the first course which was dismal we cancelled the rest of the courses and left. It was nice of them to take the food items we had half-eaten off the bill and only charge for the over-priced wine we had ordered. As for the atmosphere it is very dark inside and has a very touristy feel to it. 

To conclude, judging from the prices in comFranceon to other establishments, this place is a tourist trap, as it is on Via Ripetta which is off Via del Corso the main street in Rome which is crowded with tourists."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,"Nice people, okay food",Feb 2022 •,"Not sure why this restaurant is so well reviewed here. Service is friendly, and they do give you a free bottle of sparkling wine when you leave, but the food is busy and not especially remarkable. While we were there, a table of three cancelled their main courses and left after the appetizer course. I would have done the same."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Disappointing,Jan 2013 •,"The restaurant looks lovely, very romantic, low lighting, staff very smart.  However - The Emporer's New Clothes comes to mind.  It took ages to get our order in, the starters arrived before the wine.  Three of us ordered the same main meal - roasted beef.  Oh dear!  Under seasoned and actually not very nice at all.  We didn't eat it.  We ordered some vegetables which arrived aout 20 minutes after we had finished eating so we didn't eat those either.  We asked for the bill and it took 35 minutes to arrive.  To their credit they did remove the three uneaten main meals from the bill which made things a bit better but as the meal was meant to be a very special 50th birthday celebration, it was a huge disappointment.  We would not return."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,if you dont drink wine DONT go,Jan 2013 •,"saw ad hoc in first place on the site so i thought it was good so i went there even though the concierge warned me that it was not up to the hype.. he was unfortunately right...

pro's
1\ the waiter was very nice and polite.
2\ got a 2 FREE complementary bottels of Champagne even though i said i do not drink 
3\ got a 10% discount on the items from there shop 

con's
1\ very small and hard to get to your chair.
2\ was told there is a 3 week waiting list ( booked on the same day and took the best table)
3\ the experience takes at least 2 and half hours. (very slow service)
4\ the food was terrible, me and my wife could not finish any of the 9 dishes that was presented to us.

maybe because i dont drink, or i was ""over-hyped"" by the rating and expecting to taste some thing from out of this world, i did not like any thing about it, and i will never recommend it to any one i love.

i think the high ratings that AD Hoc gets is because of the free Champagne and the discount."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Terrible Experience,Feb 2022 •,"I couldn't understand how this restaurant became the first one in Rome. I had many better experiences compared to this average restaurant. The food was definitely over rated. Even if I exclude the meal, the service was extremely slow. We've waited for 1 hour 45 min for our main course to arrive. They could only bring the check after 45 more minutes. And we could leave the restaurant waiting for 3 hours in total spending only half an hour to eat. On top of all that, there were few clients due to season and many waitresses. Total disaster..."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Who the hell is writing the reviews?????,Feb 2022 •,"I cannot believe the reviews. We went to this restaurant after all the glowing reviews. I have visited Rome maybe 30 times. I was astonished by the bad service and average food. We arrived at 8 pm and there was no one around to greet.... Wandered around the restaurant and finally some one came. We sat down and were given our menues and wine list.
For 20 mins we sat  and perused the menu. All good ,another 20 we sat and waited to be served . Finally an order is placed. We recieved our food. My ragu.. Well it was more stirfry. Beef strips than any ragu I have ever eaten.
The rest of the meal followed suit. Wine was slow to come out etc. I can tell you that for a 8 pm booking we had only recieved mains at 10.30 pm.  While our plates were cleared by 9.20. More than 1 hour to get our mains is little long. We  only ordered entree and mains thank god.
We witnessed the table next to us forgo the complimentary amuse bouche. Which was placed on her plate. Then picked up and offered by the waitstaff to the next table . We could not leave quick enough. 
I generally don't quibble with rankings but this is not a restaurant worthy of 1. 
If the food is executed well but not to my taste I have no issue. Thats my problem . Not the restaurant .
Sadly this was not the case. The food was very average and overpriced . Remarkably we paid a similar price for our Michelin starred dinner in Capri only a few days before hand. Go figure"

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,A giant let down!,Feb 2022 •,"We saved, what we thought was going to be ""the best for last"" meal in Rome at Ad Hoc. Based on the number of outstanding reviews; wow, were we disappointed! The atmosphere is great, the service decent, but the food was less than mediocre, it was bad. We enjoyed so many wonderful meals on this trip; La Pergola, Trattoria Monti, Piperno; to name a few. All were delicious! We assumed it wasn't possible to have a sub par meal in Rome until Ad Hoc. The crudo course had no flavor; the prawn and oyster were actually gross. The pasta was over salted and luke warm, the truffle starters were mushy; lacking both texture and flavor. My lobster pasta was over cooked as well and I gave up half way through, when it started to feel like dutiful and not enjoyable eating. The desert was good... A tiramisu that tasted like the edible embodiment of a cappuccino.
My boyfriend doesn't drink, so no complimentary bottle of bubbly was offered to us. Personally, I like a good glass of wine, but food is most important in a place like this... or at least it should have been."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Very average,Dec 2012 •,"Lovely setting, great service and great service but the food (which is the whole point!) is very average.

We had the black truffle tasting menu. Absolutely no interest in smiling or asking how the food is, several courses nearly dropping the plate while laying it down. Portions were too big but still of acceptable standard until we reached dessert. 
We waited 25mins for the Crème Brûlée  and when we reminded the service staff, she very rudely replied, ""It's coming, okay?!"" When it came, it was only half done, with so much unmelted sugar still on top! 
Another 20mins spent just waiting for them to tally up the bill which had no breakdown. Atrotious"
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,How can this be rated the #1 in Rome,Oct 2012 •,"My wife having seen this as the highest rated place in Rome convinced me to try it. I must give those that are not familiar with my BLOG ""The PhotoGourmet"" a little background, I'm a well traveled FOODIE. We have been to Rome over a hundred times. I don't consider Rome a fine dining destination it has great local food. AD HOC was extremely disappointing !! We were looking at each other wondering if the Chef had died and been replaced by a dishwasher. I returned my first course because it some burnt calamari that was presented cold. The very nice server did replaced it with a fish carpaccio that was served warm enough that it was probably spoiled. Each course that followed was equally poor...we hardly ate anything. We gave up got a bill and left very disappointed. We had the Seafood and Truffle tasting menus the bill came to 170 EURO which we would have been glad to pay if it was enjoyable!  The only saving grace was the nice server and some nice wines."

I am really surprised this is number one.
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Average at best,Feb 2022 •,"I reserved a table at Ad Hoc for my boyfriend's birthday dinner while we were in Rome. Booking via the website was very simple and if you still want to go despite my review I'd encourage you to do the same well in advance, as the restaurant was completely full when we were there on a weeknight. 
When I say full I mean that it was full of tourists like ourselves. So the ambience was very nice, but it was hardly authentic. There was one table of Italian speakers (who also seemed like tourists) that walked in as we waited for our desert.
Waiting was a big theme throughout the evening. We both ordered the Roman-style tasting menu and waited about 15-20 minutes between each of the 4 courses. 
The wine pairings were very disappointing and a couple of them were just bad. They only served wines from Lazio - three heavy reds, and a desert wine (which was undrinkable). The servers recited juts the names and didn't seem at all knowledgable about the wines. 
The food itself wasn't great either though it came in wide variety. Only one of three starters and one of three first courses were really good. Neither of the two main courses were edible as thy were too salty and overcooked. I also overheard the guy at the next table who ordered the same tasting menu Say the same thing to the server as he returned his plate. The desert was fine.
Overall, not exceptional and not recommended. I'd say average, but for the price (80 euro per person) I expected more."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Bad hoc'd,Aug 2012 •,"Upon entering, thought we scored with a great atmosphere and pleasant staff. Had a fabulous beef carpaccio appetizer and a skeevishly warm seafood tartar appetizer. Our beef truffle entre was cold, dry, and clearly reheated. The suckling pig was more like pork jerky. The stuffed rabbit was not what was expected and had two large pieces of solid fat in it. It was much like a rabbit meat loaf. The wine list was great but we do not recommend wasting your money and time at Ad Hoc"
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,A big disappointment to food lover!!,Feb 2022 •,"Go Ad Hoc if you don't mind articifical service and tourist style truffles menu.

I did lot of research before all trips for food and TripAdvisor is one good source.  I seldom picked the top 10 restaurants as it was rated high mostly because of the no of visits are highest, and the restaurant is likely a commercialized tourist place.   This time I made a big mistake to choose Ad Hoc because it is just 3 min walk from our Boutique hotel and convenient for dinner.

It was a total waste of time and money.   Food quality was much below average especially if you consider the price.   Bread was cold and nothing special.   All truffle dishes tasted alike, salty and could not match well with the pasta or meat.  Carbonara was disaster.  My lady girlfriend just touched a bit and left all in the plate.

Service was artificial and slow.  The only good thing was they speak good English while most local Italian restaurant not.   The waiter was cruel in the beginning and started to smile after her manager turned up to greet us.   But you could tell that it was tourist place kind of service.

We visited a small restaurant just around the corner the other day which was much better.   At least the ingredient was fresh and the smile was genuine."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Experiment was awful.,Jun 2012 •,"Restaurant - for tourists! That has read on a site, and has seen, these are two different things. Experiment was awful. In salad begun to ruccola which was in a bottom that it haven't noticed, bound together macaroni and unfairly expensive wines. The account comprised any percent and not clear dish. In my opinion it has been obviously overestimated! Italian at this restaurant isn't present anything, as it seemed to me. I think, Italians aren't frequenters of this institution!!!! When I was, saw only tourists and heard only English-speaking speech. I believe in Rome there are enough wonderful places which can be visited, instead of this institution!!!!!"
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Tourist trap,Feb 2022 •,"I feel ridiculous that we let the reviews of tourists guide us to where to eat good italian food. Besides for good service and wine the food was below average and extremely over priced (80euro pp). The truffle dishes were terribly salty, the shrimps not fresh, we sent them back. The whole night I suffered from heartburn from the plethora of butter in the cooking. In summary, you know the saying, when in Rome... Well here we didn't hear Italian being spoken."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,MAJOR Disappointment...Terrible Service....Average Food,May 2012 •,"I give the food 3 stars (average) and service 1 star (terrible)...for an overall rating of 2.
My fiance and I dined at Ad Hoc for our last meal of our 14 day Italian vacation. My 3rd trip to Rome. I did a lot of research and spent a lot of time choosing our restaurants for dinner. We were really looking forward to Ad Hoc on our last night in Rome. I now find it hard to believe all of the good reviews on trip advisor.  Before anyone books a reservation, I would urge you to read the less favorable reviews.  You will find 3 consistent themes:  Slow poor service, average food, high prices. 
Based upon the reviews, I expected the service to be extremely slow. It was beyond that...we and the other tables around us went through long periods of at least 30 minutes without ever seeing a waitress. 
A couple of quick notes:
1. The place is beautiful....very nicely decorated and comfortable elegant setting.
2. The food is very average.  I had the cacio e pepe, sea bass, and Italian cheese appetizer....none of the food was that good. My girlfriend had a pasta dish that was good...but not great considering all of the phenomenal food elsewhere on our trip.
3. The service is AWFUL.  We live in Los Angeles and I'm orginally from NY.  We are used to good and poor service in restaurants. I can even excuse poor service if the food is exceptional. That was not the case here. First, we were seated at the same time as 2 other tables with couples and provided menus.  I noticed the other tables were provided with wine lists but we were not. Waitress came by and asked if we wanted still or sparkling water...but no mention of wine.  I decided I would wait to see if she noticed.  30 minutes later she comes by to take our order....no mention of wine. 30 minutes later...appetizers come.  30 minutes later, appetizer plates are cleared. 45 minutes later main course arrives. At this point waitress asked ""Oh I'm sorry...do you want wine?""  I respectfully declined.  
An hour after serving us our main course, they finally clear the plates.  Another 1/2 hour goes by and nobody comes to our table to ask if we wanted dessert or coffee.  Finally, after more than 3 frustrating hours I politlely ask for the check.  After 15 minutes...no check!!!  So I finally get up and track down a waitress and ask again for the check. She responded very coldly...I'm trying to pay my bill!
To be clear....we noticed the same situation occuring with 2 other tables around us.  One couple sitting at the table directly in front of us where clearly unhappy and uncomfortable with the slow service.  They were constantly looking around for a waitress. My fiance noticed a guy dining alone sitting directly behind me.  She felt bad for him because he was seated and then left at the table without anything for 45 minutes before a waitress came to his table. 
This was an overall regrettable experience. This place could be a great restaurant...but with bad service and average food and outrageous prices....there are PLENTY of better options in Rome. Save your money and find other options.  Beautiful place, but not worth it."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Terrible service,May 2012 •,"I reserved a table for 3 about a month before my trip to Rome because of the rave reviews on Tripadvisor. I am sorry to report back with an extremely negative review and I hope that I'm the only one who experienced this:

We arrived on time and was greeted by a lovely waitress and we told them who we were. It took them a rather long time to search for my reservation and seated us at the worst table possible in the entire restaurant - right beside a serving counter where all the dirty dishes were. We were looking at the back the entire night!! This became a major problem when we wanted to ask for the bill and in general got forgotten the whole night. 

1) We were in clear view of all the dirty dishes, the chaos, the drama and the waitress talk - all of which should be kept behind the scenes and not shown to us. 
2) The time difference between us finishing our course and the next course took more than 30 minutes. When we finished a course, the dishes were also cleared about 20-30 minutes later, so we spent most of the time looking at time, trying to get their attention, waiting for them to clear our dishes, while they zoomed in and out of their counter oblivious to our increasing impatience.
3) I honestly felt that they could have given us a better table since I reserved a month to 2 in advance?? 

The service and the waiting made the entire experience really miserable. It was such a nightmare trying to get their attention that we asked for the bill at the same time when we reminded them that we had a dessert that was not yet served. It is a pity that the lack of service has to ruin the chef's effort because the food there is pretty good but without the appropriate staff and amount of manpower, the restaurant just ruins the entire experience. I don't require the staff to smile and be exceptionally friendly, but the waiting and the inattentiveness really bothers me. 

I hope that the management will solve this and perhaps try not to seat anyone near the counter."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Shocked by the great reviews,Dec 2011 •,"I made reservations at Ad Hoc based on the Trip Advisor reviews. I'm assuming we were there on an 'off' night, because it was an awful experience. 

First, they could not find my reservation. I had to go through my emails for 20 minutes before they 'found' our table. 

More importantly, though, the food was disgusting! We literally left most of it on the plates. Mu husband had the ""Land and Sea"" tasting menu and I had the ""Roman Style"" tasting menu, both with wine pairings. I had such high expectations, but the food looked and tasted like over-salted, previously frozen left overs. My meat course was supposed to be Ham Roulades, but all I remember to this day are dried out discs of mystery meat on my plate. 

The best part of the meal was the wine, but the food certainly wasn't worth the effort."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Our worst dining experience in Rome,May 2012 •,"Having had some really good food during our stay in Rome some meals costing only a few Euros, we decided to top off our last evening by visiting this restaurant which had good reviews on TA.
It was a memorable evening, unfortunately for all the wrong reasons.
We made a reservation an hour before, although they will have you believe the restaurant is so exclusive you must book a long way ahead. There were empty tables the night we went.
The specialism at this venue is a ""tasting menu"" accompanied by wine with each course at a cost of between 79 euros and 129 euros. We went for this as the individual menu was also very expensive.
Having been at the restaurant over an hour we had only just had our cold starter which although pretty to look at, tasted of nothing.
Almost an hour after that we were served a pasta course which for me was 3 different variations on pasta carbonara. Again nicely presented but almost cold. I would have sent it back but couldnt catch anyones eye. Therfore most of it was left and when the waitress came for the plates I told her I was disappointed in the dish. She said she was sorry I was disappointed.
We had been in the restaurant almost 2 and a half hours before the main course arrived by which time another party of 4 had left before finishing their courses. As only one of them spoke English or Italian they were at somewhat of a disavantage but were clearly unhappy and again there was a bland response to their concerns.
When our main course arrived I again said how disappointed I was with the experience thus far and that as it was now almost 10-30pm my appetite had waned. The lady serving said it wasnt her fault, they were at the mercy of the kitchen and chef so I offered to spaek personally to the chef, manager, owner, whoever was available. My offer was not taken up but several minutes later I was approached by another member of waiting staff who had come to tell me that my choice of desert was no longer available and would I like strudel. I declined and repeated my disappointment with the restaurant overall. She said she was sorry but the problem clearly lay with me as another customer had that evening had the same menu as I and he had enjoyed it and perhaps I lacked appreciation that all the food was freshly cooked. My response was that I could have cooked fresh carbonara in a lot less time than almost 1.5 hours plus and also produced it hot enough to eat.
She seemed keen to engage me in an arguement which I declined and we left soon after having spent 3 hours and over 200 euros for a mediocre meal in a very pretentious atmosphere which showed you dont always get what you pay for. They deducted 19 euros from the bill in consideration of the desert being unavailable.
On the plus side, the wine courses were good, not great but good and my husband said his beef was of the best quality.
In summary if pretentious snobbishness with astronomical prices appeals more than good honest food then this is the place to go but there are far better places in Rome with better food and service at a fraction of these prices."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Overrated Tourist Trap,Mar 2012 •,"Living in Rome for almost five years, we have explored the Roman food scene and have truly found some gems. Over the years though, we have become somewhat complacent with our bubble of comfortable restaurants that we have discovered.

Now about to move from Rome, I got curious and checked trip advisor to see what others had thought of our beloved restaurants. Surprisingly, most of the highest rated restaurants I had never been to. Seeing this, I got ever more curious: perhaps we had missed out on a whole series of incredible restaurants in Rome? We decided to find out.

Ad Hoc was our first challenge to our previous favorites in Rome. Me, my mother, and girlfriend were excited. Rated so highly on trip advisor, I was truly expecting something above and beyond the rest.

The evening started well. We walked in without reservations and were seated promptly directly next to the hostess’s desk where they make reservations. The waitress kindly welcomed us, and everything seemed to be going well. The décor was also deliberate, and designed, unlike most of the humble family restaurants in Rome, where you are likely to see the walls decorated with a mosaic of football memorabilia from Forza Roma and photos of Italian movie actors and actresses from the 50s. This was refreshing for Rome, despite the fact that it definitely felt a little forced. 

The only disconcerting thing (so far) was the fact that there wasn’t an Italian customer in sight. A few English speaking customers surrounded us, and a German family was within sight in the other room.

After being seated, we were all served complimentary prossecco. The bread was notably good also. Not a bad start at all. The menu looked exciting as well. It is uncommon in Rome to find a chef willing to experiment. The menu contained twists on local Roman classics, as well as a list of dishes with truffles used as their main flavor and inspiration. I ordered the “Ad Hoc” gnocchi, my mother ordered the cacio e peppe, and my girlfriend ordered the carbonara three ways. We also tried a few appetizers: Roman style artichokes, fried pumpkin flowers, and some fried cheese wrap.

That is where the romance ended. First, one wine we ordered tasted as if it were watered down. I don't know any other way to describe it. We are not exactly wine snobs, but this wine was genuinely awful. We ordered a different wine and it was better, but still bad. The third was decent.

The appetizers, all fried, seemed as if they had been fried earlier and reheated somehow later. One of the fried cheese balls was actually room temperature. 
The food, both appetizers and main courses, were lacking flavor. The textures were off. Everything was slightly warm, but verging on room temperature. Felt reheated. 

The carbonara was very very sad, some of the worst we have ever had. Strange bland gnocchi. Soggy fried appetizers, caricatures of Roman classics.  The best was the caccio e pepe, which was below average. Everything was lacking punch. Depressing attempts at experimental. 

To be blunt, the food was awful. Far below average for Rome, at above average prices.

They also had a bizarre ritual of checking the reservation book before letting people in, even though they obviously knew that there were plenty of open seats. A depressing performance art. 

On the good side, the service was very attentive. Very helpful. No problems with the wait as other reviewers had described.. 

When we left, we were given a free bottle of prosecco. I am not sure if this because they thought we didn't enjoy our experience, but it was appreciated. 

Overall, this place is a tourist trap. There is a reason you don't see Italians here."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Uncomfortbale and disappointing,Mar 2012 •,"My good friend and I decided to try Ad Hoc after many times of walking past after our full days of shopping in the city center. As soon as we walk in we were greeted by a sloppy and tacky shelf of magazines and books that hadn't been organized, dusted or paid any attention to it seemed in ages.  Ignoring this eye sore, we were seated in a tiny room with tables that were so close together that you could hear everything everyone was saying or doing and couldnt sit or eat comfortably. It was also filled with tired tourists, making the restaunt feel less genuine and more phony than one would want. Also, the room was lined with hundreds of dusty wine bottles that were very inconvienently placed at elbow level. So everytime you took a bite to eat you worried you were going to break an assumingly expensive bottle of wine. Also, to fetch a bottle of wine a waitress would have to interupt your dinner to manouevre it off the shelf. Because everything was so cluttered and cramped you felt you had to whisper and watch what you said during dinner so that the entire restaurant wouldn't hear your conversation. Not ok. So trying to ignore the tacky and cramped interior we had only high hopes for the food. The plates came out and  were very lovely, giving any reasonable person an expectaion of a delicious and gourmet meal. Every course was un utter disappointment. The food tasted like a any run of the mill restaurant, absolutely not worth the price, or even half the price. The portions were tiny and mediorcre at best though trying to be pretentious and superior. All night we had no idea who our waitress was and what language to speak to them in, as they kept mixing English and Italian. So to end a compete let down of a night I was brought the absolute worst tiramsu of all time. No exaggeration. It was disgusting. It tasted like watered down american coffee with a dollop of cream on top and soggy bread. I took one bite and pushed it away.  All in all this was a complete waste of money (as the food was insanely expensive), time, and of a perfectly good evening with a girl friend that could have been spent somewhere else more chic, tasty, authentic, and altogether more pleasant and comfortable. If you ask me, go somewhere else!"
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Very bad food and service - not worthy the money spent,Nov 2011 •,"You arrived 10 min earlier, and had to wait in the street, because they didn't offer any place to stay inside while waiting- just rude! It was November and very very cold outside.

The waitresses seem to be learning which is not expected in a place with so high prices.

The food quality was poor - I didn't finish my main course because it was unpleasant. Next morning I had an upset tummy.

It was our wedding anniversary, so they offered us a botlle of champagne, before we left, which was nice, but we're so dissapointed by that time, that didn't made the difference."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Pretty dissappointing.,Feb 2022 •,"I actually never write reviews for the restaurants, but for this one i just had to. The reason we decided to check this place out was only because of high ratings  on TA. I am still dissapointed about the choice we've made.Our dinner at this place was...well the right word for it would be BLAH... We have always dined at such wonderful places when visiting Rome before Ad Hoc. The atmosphere was very average and the way they seated people made it more uncomfortable. Do not even think to dress up for this one( even you think u r in Italy) it is very casual and reminded me of a coffee shop. I don't have anything bad to say about the service at our table, but nothing good either! They are really big on truffles on the menu, but that evening they were out of lots of things, so we did not have a lot to choose from.  The wine list is great tho. I did not see any managers on the floor, but the grumpy eastern European  looking man was very noticeable so as an owefully loud woman who was given the recipes to the guests next to us throughout our entire dinner. She was an employee or  my thought an owner and she was  really  loud to the point that I wanted to ask her to tune it down a little. Food was eatable and nothing to write home about till I got the cream brûlée. Instead of a nice and chilled on the inside and brown and crispy on the top I got Hot plate with Sprinckled  sugar on top.... My guess they just put it in the microwave instead of doing it the right way!!! Of course I didn't it touch it and we asked or the check. But no one even asked if something was wrong with it.  We did not complaint and just wanted to forget about an owefull experience , but the top position on TA list of restaurants in Rome is just making me sad again."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Sorry,Feb 2012 •,"I'm afraid we were very let down by this restaurant.
We were left standing at the door for 5 minutes before being seated. We decided on the tasting menu for Land with wine. Although given a glass of prosecco when we were shown to our table, it took 35 minutes before we were served any food. 
Asparagus Roulade was overcooked.
Ravioli with Rabbit Ragout was very salty.
Ad Hoc Gnocchi were hard in the corners and I could have made a better sugo.
Saltimbocca alla Romana tasted like reconstituted meat in a roll.
Tiramisu was waterery and tasteless.
The service was fauning and pretentious.
Although I left alot on my plate uneaten I was never asked why until the dessert.
And finally as we were leaving we were given a cheap bottle of Spumante in a brown paper bag to take away. Why?
The only positive was that the wines were good.
All of this took almost 4 hours.
Would I recommend this restaurant? Absolutely not. Don't waste your time and money. There are far better places to eat in Rome."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,rotten starter - no apology. otherwise ok albeit overpriced,Dec 2011 •,"10 of us ate on christmas day at Ad Hoc - we were seated in a seperate area which initally we thought would be good but ended up meaning we were ignored. One of our startes came and as we cut into the pasta dumping it was clear it was rotten (rotten fish is fairly easy to detect) we asked the waitress and she removed the plate without saying anything. our main courses came and they brought another of the starter, now without rotten crab inside but fairly empty because of it - still no apology. my aunt had eaten a piece before realising anything was wrong and was pretty upset about it.
the rest of the meal was ok but very expensive and the service continued to be pretty patchy. we werent offered anything off the bill or a dessert to say sorry - really disappointed"
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Overrated. Bad service.,Dec 2011 •,"We walked in with a ressie to an empty restaurant, but for one couple. They jammed us in corner next to them, so we asked to move. She said she ""had to check""! It was absurd. They moved us begrudgingly, and we watched 3 couples get the same treatment. We did not like our food, and were disappointed."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,"Very slow, average food, lack of wine, totally over-priced",Dec 2011 •,"Visited Ad Hoc for NYE with my husband and was very disappointed with the evening. It was a set menu with wine pairings for a set price of 190 Euros EACH. We arrived at 8pm and we're greeted with a small glass of prosecco, a nice touch but we then waited 1 hour for our starter and our first glass of wine. The starter was very average. We then waited 2 hours for our main and we we still hadn't had a wine refill so in the end we had to ask the waitress if we could purchase additional wine. The waitress gave us a refill but the fact we had to ask and had had 1 glass of prosecco and 1 glass of wine in 3 hours was just not good enough. The two couples next to us also asked for more wine.  One lady was literally falling asleep at the table. Two other couples were ordering espresso which we assumed was to help them to stay awake.  The main was again very average and cold. The 'sea' menu was mainly just deep fried fish and sea food. We complained again about the time it was taking and the fact that we had been without wine for a further 30 minutes (at least).  The atmosphere was awful and very flat as everyone was so frustrated and had only had 3 glasses of wine all evening so the New Year came and went without many people noticing. The couple next to us were still waiting to be served their main meal after midnight.  We had to complain twice about the time it was taking and the lack of wine which ruined the evening completely as we are not the complaining types. Overall the service was average and very, very slow, at 380 Euros for two it was completely and utterly over priced as the food at best was very average.  We believe the Ad Hoc tasting menu with wine is normally 70 Euros and I think hiking the price up to 190 Euros per person was a mistake as the food, service did not live up to the price. We have eaten at many nice restaurants and would have expected a lot more for a NYE meal for the price they charged. We wish we had popped into a local Trattoria and enjoyed the fireworks and atmosphere in the Pizazza del Popolo. Incidentally, we had planned to watch the fireworks in the Piazza del Popolo but missed them due to the fact that the meal in the end took 5 hours! A very, very disappointing evening."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Poor service,Nov 2011 •,"I can't comment on the food but the service was below par. We didn't have a reservation but it was still on the early side of dinner time. The restaurant had plenty of open tables however we were told they were full. When we asked about a reservation the next night we were told they were full for the next 2 nights, all this without looking at a reservation log book.
Needless to say we didn't try to dine here again."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Unfortunately disappointing,Oct 2011 •,"We reserved a table through the website. This was very comfortable. We received a receipt. The atmorphere of the restaurant is very nice. The waitresses are very friendly, too. But it took very long until we could order. The gave us a complementary glas of prosecco. Overall the food was not really good except for the fettucine with truffels. The main course with meat was not good at all. We returned it to the kitchen. Overall the meal took 3.5 hours which was a lot of waiting. The restaurant was far too expensive for the value. After all the nice food we had in Rome in the small simple restaurants I would not go there again."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Rude and inflexible,Oct 2011 •,"We had a reservation for 4 people, but was joined by a 5th at the last minute. As this was a child we hoped this would not be a problem. This couldn't have been further from the truth. 

The lady that dealt with us could not have been less helpful, in fact she was bordering on rude and aggressive. If our request for an extra chair at the end of a table for 4 was so difficult for a restaurant to handle, fair enough, but at least decline our request in a polite, professional manner... Sadly not the case at Ad Hoc."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Absolutely not best in Rome - Would not return,Oct 2011 •,"With much anticipation we arrived for our reservation.  We were promptly seated, but then the trouble started.  It took nearly an hour for our order to be taken.  Sadly they were out of many menu items, including some featured in the hailed tasting menus.  Our dinner took nearly 4 hours with painfully slow service and most of the time with empty water and wine glasses.  Servers were completely inattentive.  I sensed that the entire dining room was annoyed with the poor service.  Food was OK, but several items on our tasting menu were cold and inedible.  Please save yourself the time and money.  There is absolutely no way that this is the best place in Rome."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Expected the TA rating's and I was disapointed,Feb 2022 •,"Walked in and didn't get in, so made a reservation, confirmed thru e-mail. Arrived on time and they made us feel unwelcomed likethere was no reservation an after all they gave us a terrible table. Next to the waiters station. (never accept that table). They where out of squid and truffle as a welcome. But surprise 50% of the menu had truffle. I asked for help with the wine list. And never got help from the maitre'd and even approached our table. Would never go back."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,expensive rubbish,Sept 2011 •,"it took nearly 5 hours for them to complete our meal. They forgot to process our main course!!! Even our coffee took 30mins to arrive. What did they do go to brazil to pick the beans themselves. All this cost us 228€ for 2 of us. The food when it did arrive was average. Not to be recommended, look for where the locals go because it's not here!"
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,A boring four and a half hours that could have been superb,Oct 2011 •,"We arrived at 08.15 with table booked for 08.30. No problem, made to feel very welcome. Problems started after first course.... I do not think the kitchen was able to cope with the meal orders..... seriously it took them four and a half hours to serve us our meal. The waitresses kept on apologising saying 'would not be long', 'working on yours now', 'yours is next to be cooked', etc.......
I think this is about the only restaurant I have left without leaving a tip.
It could have been superb if the kitchen timing was sorted, but the speed of non service spolit everything."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,How can this be the no. 1 restaurant in Rome ???,Oct 2011 •,"There wasn't one Italian person in this place. Only tourist, who like ourselves, read the reviews on tripadvisor and decided to venture there.
While the service was kind (but as the crowd, not local), the food was over trying and disappointing. Nothing close to the traditionally simple and qualitative cuisine you expect in Italy. 
DON'T GO THERE !!!"
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,lost the touch,Oct 2011 •,"We went there for all the good critics here in tripadvisor, but sadly service was terrible and ambience was boring and 1 hour to serve the appetaizer and one more for the entre. food was ok and the waitress try to be nice but not enough. wouldn´t repit."

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,This place lacks human decency,Sept 2011 •,"My husband and I are in Rome for our honeymoon and read up on Ad Hoc thinking it would be a nice treat. I made the reservations online and was accepted instantly. We showed up last night at 8pm all dressed up for our reservation when the woman kept going to the back of the restaurant looking it up again while seating other people. The restaurant at this point was empty and stayed that way at least to 8:15pm. It turns out in human error on my part after visiting 3 cities in 10 days I made the reservation for tonight at 8pm instead of last night. They refused to seat us! I ask nicely telling them we are on our honeymoon and all they said was 'so sorry' and escorted us to the door as if we were trying to break in. There was no manager (that I was aware of in sight) as I can't imagine they'd let this behavoir take place. I would also like to add that it was about 85 degrees last night and this place has NO AIR CONDITIONING. A part of us were relieved to not have to eat in that smoltering heat.
After eating a very lovely meal up the street (there are tons of great places to choose from). My husband wanted to walk by Ad Hoc to see if they were 'completely booked'. Although they were more crowded they definitely could have accommodated us. We're from NYC and I honestly could never see this happening there regardless of who made the error. I'm sure this review won't affect anyones desire to try this place, but hopefully it will affect the way their staff treats people."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Stay clear of this place!,Feb 2022 •,"After a 10 day vacation in Italy we wanted to have a really special meal for the last evening (allthough I must admit our holiday was full of special meals...). Having passed the restaurant earlier in the afternoon my husband really liked the interior, and I liked that they had lobster w honeyglazed lemon on the menue, so we decided to eat there if they had a free table for us. Returning later in the evening we were greeted by a very friendly waitress and yes, they had room for us. Plenty of empty tables that evening actually (Sunday Nov. 7). Since we had been really overeating the whole trip, and I hadn´t read any reviews on this restaurant, we decided to just go for the ""secondi piatti"" and skip the antipasti. Well, good for us that we did. We did get the complementary sparkling white whine, and then went for the lobster on my part, and four try-out meat-courses for hubby.  I agree with others, the servings were really small, and our consolation in that respect was that we were in need of dieting anyway. Plates were cold, sucking the warmth out of the food. My lobster was pieces of lobster served on a square of cold, dry rice. Lobster was ok, as the strings of honey-glazed lemons. As a side order we had green asparagus with parmeggiano cheese; the asparagus wasn´t quite done so hard to chew, and the parmeggiano? Well, I am no expert, but it tasted like generic if there is such a thing when it comes to parmeggiano. Dry and tasteless! My husband's glass of wine was more like one fourth glass, and measured digitally, mind you! We wew served a basket of bread with the food without asking for it, and really didn´t touch it, but lo and behold: they charged us for the bread!!! Not even in the cheapest joint! But here, oh yes, and 3 € it was! By the time we were actually finished and served the bill by the ever-sweet waitress and noticed this we could only laugh! Thank God for speaking an unusual language (Swedish) and being able to laugh and comment on this experience at the spot.  The whole time a v ery unpleasant unsmiling man (the owner?) kept lurching in and out from the back of the restaurant. At one point one of teh waitresses seemed to try to cheer him up a bit by wrapping herself intimately around him in the back room behind our table (my seating position made it impossible for me not to notice), but to no avail. He remained very serous end stern. Everytime one of the waitresses received money from a guest he popped out to take it and check the bill, so strange, and it semed our waitress was a bit uncomfortable with this. If so eager, why didn´t he do the charging himself? All in all, a total flop for the prices they charge. There are so many other good restaurants in Rome, so do avoid this one !"

We waited for our starters for almost one hour! Just because they told us they were cutting by hand our Salumi, including Serrano Ham. I come from Spain, where, in quarter an hour you can have at least 6 traies of fresh-cut serrano ham!!! and when we told tthe waitress how slow they were she replied as if we where the guilty ones who had chosen that starter and knew how long it took it to prepare it! (on top of that the ham wasn`t even good)
Moreover it took us half an hour to have the bill!!
For God`s sake! I really encourage you not to go there!!!"
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,disappointing - after reading such great reviews,Feb 2022 •,"I was in Rome this weekend and i had booked a table here 2 weeks prior to me arriving.
Their website stated that you would be welcomed with a glass of Prosecco (f.o.c), well we were not.
We were put at a table and left, then the waitress came back and asked if we would like some water. We were then left alone again.
While we were sat waiting for the menu and wine menu, we had an Italian couple come and sit next to us. Within seconds they had 2 glasses of Prosecco and all the menus they could ask for.
When the waitress returned she gave us our menu and said she would be back in 5, (we had been there for 20 mins) to take our order. At this point i decided not to stay and when the waitress returned i said could we pay for the water, and we were leaving.
When she asked why i stated that it was because i felt as if i had been treated like an idiot. Stating that thier website says they offer a free glass of Prosecco as a welcome gift, and we hadnt recieved one (when the couple on the next table did), she said that it was not a problem and offered to get us a glass, but that wasnt the point. I also said that we hadnt been given a menu for a while and i just felt that because i wasnt Italian that i was being treated unfairly ...... ( I happen to have proposed to my girlfriend earlier on in the day and was really looking forward to a lovely meal) which we did have elsewhere.
Sorry to be a bummer but i was gutted.."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Ad Hoc - yes some of the details of this restaurant are ad hoc,Feb 2022 •,We had a fab break in Rome for my 40th; the meal at Glass Hostaria was a highlight and we hoped for the same the following night at Ad Hoc as we'd read so many good reviews but it failed to reach our expectations. The maitre d'/sommelier seemed knowledgable and efficient but the dishes just did not deliver; I had the sea bass which had been taken off the bone badly so I was fishing out needle bones all through the meal and the nice potatoes they served with it were cold. My husband had a steak which was fine and a side order of fried potatoes which turned out to be frozen chips! We waited 40 minutes for the bill and I don't think for a bill of over £120 frozen anything is acceptable.

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,How not to be disappointed?,May 2024 •,"It was presented to us as one of the best Roman restaurants.
But had it not been for the setting, with so many beautiful bottles on the walls, and the kindness of the service, there was nothing but disappointment on the plate, whether it was the zucchini flowers with ricotta or the fresh pasta with summer truffles, tasteless and spoiled by the presence of useless grass. We will salute the Ornellaia which allowed us to dine on a more festive note."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Overrated and touristy,Mar 2024 •,"Unfortunately the food was just average. No dish was really convincing. The greeting from the kitchen was okay but not a highlight in terms of taste.

The tartare had a bland taste and relied on the fact that it was served with truffles. The artichoke stuffed with yarn didn't actually taste like anything.

The carbonara tasted good but was a bit too salty.

Unfortunately, the desserts were completely ill-thought out. I had mine returned too.

All dishes lack that certain something.

The wine list was great. Unfortunately the selection of open wines was not good."

Instead of a nice and chilled on the inside and brown and crispy on the top I got Hot plate with Sprinckled  sugar on top.... My guess they just put it in the microwave instead of doing it the right way!!! Of course I didn't it touch it and we asked or the check. But no one even asked if something was wrong with it.  We did not complaint and just wanted to forget about an owefull experience , but the top position on TA list of restaurants in Rome is just making me sad again."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Sorry,Feb 2012 •,"I'm afraid we were very let down by this restaurant.
We were left standing at the door for 5 minutes before being seated. We decided on the tasting menu for Land with wine. Although given a glass of prosecco when we were shown to our table, it took 35 minutes before we were served any food. 
Asparagus Roulade was overcooked.
Ravioli with Rabbit Ragout was very salty.
Ad Hoc Gnocchi were hard in the corners and I could have made a better sugo.
Saltimbocca alla Romana tasted like reconstituted meat in a roll.
Tiramisu was waterery and tasteless.
The service was fauning and pretentious.
Although I left alot on my plate uneaten I was never asked why until the dessert.
And finally as we were leaving we were given a cheap bottle of Spumante in a brown paper bag to take away. Why?
The only positive was that the wines were good.
All of this took almost 4 hours.
Would I recommend this restaurant? Absolutely not. Don't waste your time and money. There are far better places to eat in Rome."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,rotten starter - no apology. otherwise ok albeit overpriced,Dec 2011 •,"10 of us ate on christmas day at Ad Hoc - we were seated in a seperate area which initally we thought would be good but ended up meaning we were ignored. One of our startes came and as we cut into the pasta dumping it was clear it was rotten (rotten fish is fairly easy to detect) we asked the waitress and she removed the plate without saying anything. our main courses came and they brought another of the starter, now without rotten crab inside but fairly empty because of it - still no apology. my aunt had eaten a piece before realising anything was wrong and was pretty upset about it.
the rest of the meal was ok but very expensive and the service continued to be pretty patchy. we werent offered anything off the bill or a dessert to say sorry - really disappointed"
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Overrated. Bad service.,Dec 2011 •,"We walked in with a ressie to an empty restaurant, but for one couple. They jammed us in corner next to them, so we asked to move. She said she ""had to check""! It was absurd. They moved us begrudgingly, and we watched 3 couples get the same treatment. We did not like our food, and were disappointed."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,"Very slow, average food, lack of wine, totally over-priced",Dec 2011 •,"Visited Ad Hoc for NYE with my husband and was very disappointed with the evening. It was a set menu with wine pairings for a set price of 190 Euros EACH. We arrived at 8pm and we're greeted with a small glass of prosecco, a nice touch but we then waited 1 hour for our starter and our first glass of wine. The starter was very average. We then waited 2 hours for our main and we we still hadn't had a wine refill so in the end we had to ask the waitress if we could purchase additional wine. The waitress gave us a refill but the fact we had to ask and had had 1 glass of prosecco and 1 glass of wine in 3 hours was just not good enough. The two couples next to us also asked for more wine.  One lady was literally falling asleep at the table. Two other couples were ordering espresso which we assumed was to help them to stay awake.  The main was again very average and cold. The 'sea' menu was mainly just deep fried fish and sea food. We complained again about the time it was taking and the fact that we had been without wine for a further 30 minutes (at least).  The atmosphere was awful and very flat as everyone was so frustrated and had only had 3 glasses of wine all evening so the New Year came and went without many people noticing. The couple next to us were still waiting to be served their main meal after midnight.  We had to complain twice about the time it was taking and the lack of wine which ruined the evening completely as we are not the complaining types. Overall the service was average and very, very slow, at 380 Euros for two it was completely and utterly over priced as the food at best was very average.  We believe the Ad Hoc tasting menu with wine is normally 70 Euros and I think hiking the price up to 190 Euros per person was a mistake as the food, service did not live up to the price. We have eaten at many nice restaurants and would have expected a lot more for a NYE meal for the price they charged. We wish we had popped into a local Trattoria and enjoyed the fireworks and atmosphere in the Pizazza del Popolo. Incidentally, we had planned to watch the fireworks in the Piazza del Popolo but missed them due to the fact that the meal in the end took 5 hours! A very, very disappointing evening."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Poor service,Nov 2011 •,"I can't comment on the food but the service was below par. We didn't have a reservation but it was still on the early side of dinner time. The restaurant had plenty of open tables however we were told they were full. When we asked about a reservation the next night we were told they were full for the next 2 nights, all this without looking at a reservation log book.
Needless to say we didn't try to dine here again."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Unfortunately disappointing,Oct 2011 •,"We reserved a table through the website. This was very comfortable. We received a receipt. The atmorphere of the restaurant is very nice. The waitresses are very friendly, too. But it took very long until we could order. The gave us a complementary glas of prosecco. Overall the food was not really good except for the fettucine with truffels. The main course with meat was not good at all. We returned it to the kitchen. Overall the meal took 3.5 hours which was a lot of waiting. The restaurant was far too expensive for the value. After all the nice food we had in Rome in the small simple restaurants I would not go there again."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Rude and inflexible,Oct 2011 •,"We had a reservation for 4 people, but was joined by a 5th at the last minute. As this was a child we hoped this would not be a problem. This couldn't have been further from the truth. 

The lady that dealt with us could not have been less helpful, in fact she was bordering on rude and aggressive. If our request for an extra chair at the end of a table for 4 was so difficult for a restaurant to handle, fair enough, but at least decline our request in a polite, professional manner... Sadly not the case at Ad Hoc."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Absolutely not best in Rome - Would not return,Oct 2011 •,"With much anticipation we arrived for our reservation.  We were promptly seated, but then the trouble started.  It took nearly an hour for our order to be taken.  Sadly they were out of many menu items, including some featured in the hailed tasting menus.  Our dinner took nearly 4 hours with painfully slow service and most of the time with empty water and wine glasses.  Servers were completely inattentive.  I sensed that the entire dining room was annoyed with the poor service.  Food was OK, but several items on our tasting menu were cold and inedible.  Please save yourself the time and money.  There is absolutely no way that this is the best place in Rome."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Expected the TA rating's and I was disapointed,Feb 2022 •,"Walked in and didn't get in, so made a reservation, confirmed thru e-mail. Arrived on time and they made us feel unwelcomed likethere was no reservation an after all they gave us a terrible table. Next to the waiters station. (never accept that table). They where out of squid and truffle as a welcome. But surprise 50% of the menu had truffle. I asked for help with the wine list. And never got help from the maitre'd and even approached our table. Would never go back."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,expensive rubbish,Sept 2011 •,"it took nearly 5 hours for them to complete our meal. They forgot to process our main course!!! Even our coffee took 30mins to arrive. What did they do go to brazil to pick the beans themselves. All this cost us 228€ for 2 of us. The food when it did arrive was average. Not to be recommended, look for where the locals go because it's not here!"
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,A boring four and a half hours that could have been superb,Oct 2011 •,"We arrived at 08.15 with table booked for 08.30. No problem, made to feel very welcome. Problems started after first course.... I do not think the kitchen was able to cope with the meal orders..... seriously it took them four and a half hours to serve us our meal. The waitresses kept on apologising saying 'would not be long', 'working on yours now', 'yours is next to be cooked', etc.......
I think this is about the only restaurant I have left without leaving a tip.
It could have been superb if the kitchen timing was sorted, but the speed of non service spolit everything."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,How can this be the no. 1 restaurant in Rome ???,Oct 2011 •,"There wasn't one Italian person in this place. Only tourist, who like ourselves, read the reviews on tripadvisor and decided to venture there.
While the service was kind (but as the crowd, not local), the food was over trying and disappointing. Nothing close to the traditionally simple and qualitative cuisine you expect in Italy. 
DON'T GO THERE !!!"
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,lost the touch,Oct 2011 •,"We went there for all the good critics here in tripadvisor, but sadly service was terrible and ambience was boring and 1 hour to serve the appetaizer and one more for the entre. food was ok and the waitress try to be nice but not enough. wouldn´t repit."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,TERRIBLE ATTITUDE!!!!DONT GO!!!!,Feb 2022 •,Terrible attitude as soon as walked in!!! Who do they think they are???
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,This place lacks human decency,Sept 2011 •,"My husband and I are in Rome for our honeymoon and read up on Ad Hoc thinking it would be a nice treat. I made the reservations online and was accepted instantly. We showed up last night at 8pm all dressed up for our reservation when the woman kept going to the back of the restaurant looking it up again while seating other people. The restaurant at this point was empty and stayed that way at least to 8:15pm. It turns out in human error on my part after visiting 3 cities in 10 days I made the reservation for tonight at 8pm instead of last night. They refused to seat us! I ask nicely telling them we are on our honeymoon and all they said was 'so sorry' and escorted us to the door as if we were trying to break in. There was no manager (that I was aware of in sight) as I can't imagine they'd let this behavoir take place. I would also like to add that it was about 85 degrees last night and this place has NO AIR CONDITIONING. A part of us were relieved to not have to eat in that smoltering heat.
After eating a very lovely meal up the street (there are tons of great places to choose from). My husband wanted to walk by Ad Hoc to see if they were 'completely booked'. Although they were more crowded they definitely could have accommodated us. We're from NYC and I honestly could never see this happening there regardless of who made the error. I'm sure this review won't affect anyones desire to try this place, but hopefully it will affect the way their staff treats people."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Stay clear of this place!,Feb 2022 •,"After a 10 day vacation in Italy we wanted to have a really special meal for the last evening (allthough I must admit our holiday was full of special meals...). Having passed the restaurant earlier in the afternoon my husband really liked the interior, and I liked that they had lobster w honeyglazed lemon on the menue, so we decided to eat there if they had a free table for us. Returning later in the evening we were greeted by a very friendly waitress and yes, they had room for us. Plenty of empty tables that evening actually (Sunday Nov. 7). Since we had been really overeating the whole trip, and I hadn´t read any reviews on this restaurant, we decided to just go for the ""secondi piatti"" and skip the antipasti. Well, good for us that we did. We did get the complementary sparkling white whine, and then went for the lobster on my part, and four try-out meat-courses for hubby.  I agree with others, the servings were really small, and our consolation in that respect was that we were in need of dieting anyway. Plates were cold, sucking the warmth out of the food. My lobster was pieces of lobster served on a square of cold, dry rice. Lobster was ok, as the strings of honey-glazed lemons. As a side order we had green asparagus with parmeggiano cheese; the asparagus wasn´t quite done so hard to chew, and the parmeggiano? Well, I am no expert, but it tasted like generic if there is such a thing when it comes to parmeggiano. Dry and tasteless! My husband's glass of wine was more like one fourth glass, and measured digitally, mind you! We wew served a basket of bread with the food without asking for it, and really didn´t touch it, but lo and behold: they charged us for the bread!!! Not even in the cheapest joint! But here, oh yes, and 3 € it was! By the time we were actually finished and served the bill by the ever-sweet waitress and noticed this we could only laugh! Thank God for speaking an unusual language (Swedish) and being able to laugh and comment on this experience at the spot.  The whole time a v ery unpleasant unsmiling man (the owner?) kept lurching in and out from the back of the restaurant. At one point one of teh waitresses seemed to try to cheer him up a bit by wrapping herself intimately around him in the back room behind our table (my seating position made it impossible for me not to notice), but to no avail. He remained very serous end stern. Everytime one of the waitresses received money from a guest he popped out to take it and check the bill, so strange, and it semed our waitress was a bit uncomfortable with this. If so eager, why didn´t he do the charging himself? All in all, a total flop for the prices they charge. There are so many other good restaurants in Rome, so do avoid this one !"
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Lots of fancy talk about their food and wines.All talk----no substance.,Feb 2022 •,"Agree with all previous negative reviews.Arrived 6.20PM for6.30 reservation and told to WALK ROUND THE BLOCK FOR 10 TO 15 MINUTES. Had SEA TASTER MENU. All fancy talk but quantities MINUTE.Without being told I would not have known what Iwas 
eating in many cases.Put all courses together and might just fill a plate.BY THE WAY I am in my SEVENTIES and do not eat large courses but these were ridiculous."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,SHAMEFUL,Feb 2022 •,"It was just a SHAME!

We waited for our starters for almost one hour! Just because they told us they were cutting by hand our Salumi, including Serrano Ham. I come from Spain, where, in quarter an hour you can have at least 6 traies of fresh-cut serrano ham!!! and when we told tthe waitress how slow they were she replied as if we where the guilty ones who had chosen that starter and knew how long it took it to prepare it! (on top of that the ham wasn`t even good)
Moreover it took us half an hour to have the bill!!
For God`s sake! I really encourage you not to go there!!!"
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,disappointing - after reading such great reviews,Feb 2022 •,"I was in Rome this weekend and i had booked a table here 2 weeks prior to me arriving.
Their website stated that you would be welcomed with a glass of Prosecco (f.o.c), well we were not.
We were put at a table and left, then the waitress came back and asked if we would like some water. We were then left alone again.
While we were sat waiting for the menu and wine menu, we had an Italian couple come and sit next to us. Within seconds they had 2 glasses of Prosecco and all the menus they could ask for.
When the waitress returned she gave us our menu and said she would be back in 5, (we had been there for 20 mins) to take our order. At this point i decided not to stay and when the waitress returned i said could we pay for the water, and we were leaving.
When she asked why i stated that it was because i felt as if i had been treated like an idiot. Stating that thier website says they offer a free glass of Prosecco as a welcome gift, and we hadnt recieved one (when the couple on the next table did), she said that it was not a problem and offered to get us a glass, but that wasnt the point. I also said that we hadnt been given a menu for a while and i just felt that because i wasnt Italian that i was being treated unfairly ...... ( I happen to have proposed to my girlfriend earlier on in the day and was really looking forward to a lovely meal) which we did have elsewhere.
Sorry to be a bummer but i was gutted.."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Ad Hoc - yes some of the details of this restaurant are ad hoc,Feb 2022 •,We had a fab break in Rome for my 40th; the meal at Glass Hostaria was a highlight and we hoped for the same the following night at Ad Hoc as we'd read so many good reviews but it failed to reach our expectations. The maitre d'/sommelier seemed knowledgable and efficient but the dishes just did not deliver; I had the sea bass which had been taken off the bone badly so I was fishing out needle bones all through the meal and the nice potatoes they served with it were cold. My husband had a steak which was fine and a side order of fried potatoes which turned out to be frozen chips! We waited 40 minutes for the bill and I don't think for a bill of over £120 frozen anything is acceptable.
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,How not to be disappointed?,May 2024 •,"It was presented to us as one of the best Roman restaurants.
But had it not been for the setting, with so many beautiful bottles on the walls, and the kindness of the service, there was nothing but disappointment on the plate, whether it was the zucchini flowers with ricotta or the fresh pasta with summer truffles, tasteless and spoiled by the presence of useless grass. We will salute the Ornellaia which allowed us to dine on a more festive note."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Positive,Wonderful,Jun 2024 •,"We booked the Frog in advance and pleased we did as it was very busy…
Great bar to visit before the Green Day gig and they were playing all the Green Days song while we were there… Great choice of food and drinks and the staff were very friendly and helpful… Would definitely recommend this bar if you are in the area. Thanks to all at the Frog for an enjoyable visit… By the way Green Day were fab…"

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Positive,American Pub in France,Mar 2017 •,"Stayed in a hotel very close to this property and was looking for American style food. The Frog was written up as very ""American."" The reviews were entirely correct! Even my waiter was from the States.

Really pretty pub located in the quant but modern Bercy Villiage. Inviting and very friendly staff, the service was outstanding.  Tried the ""Empire"" home brew and it was excellent. Ordered the Fish and Chips to go with the beer and it turned out to be the perfect combo.

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Positive,Buzzing friendly joint,Jan 2017 •,"At the end of a long and freezing work day in France, this lively and warm restaurant/bar was a welcome and relaxing find.  

The bouncy waitress who greeted me at the door, Rochelle, spoke excellent English despite her French-looking name, so I didn't have to struggle with my poor French. Bonus #1 :)  

The place was packed and the only single seat Rochelle could find for me was in an obscure corner, kinda close to the toilets I think.  Before I had managed a few sips of my beer a more suitable table closer to the centre of the activity became available and the waitress offered for me to move there. That was nice. Bonus #2

I had a Hopster beer and the Crunchy Chicken (Caeser?) Salad, both of which came out in a respectable time, and complimented the lively and fresh atmosphere of the pub perfectly.  Bonus #3 and #4.  

A very pleasant evening, and conveniently close to a metro station (Bonus #5!)"

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Positive,A tasty haloumi burger - served by English-speaking staff,Oct 2016 •,"My wife and I had an hour or so to kill before our movie was to start so we stopped at The Frog for drinks and a bite to eat. We thought that our waiter, George (a lovely English chap), was doing very well in such a busy French restaurant. Although his French was perfectly fine, it was a pleasure to be able to speak English with him. He looked after us well. We did think it a shame that there was only one (slightly expensive) cider available and none on tap. The wait-time was quite reasonable, considering the place was packed out. We enjoyed the haloumi burger and kumara fries (a rare treat for a kiwi) and would certainly dine there again."

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Positive,Great Lunch,Apr 2016 •,"Went with my son when visiting France and it was his suggestion. The place is part of a chain. Service was fantastic from the time we arrived till we left. Choice of seating and we picked a table downstairs where you can see them making the beer. There is a good selection of craft beers/ales of which we tried two, both of which were exceptional. We had the 'Revolution' and 'Pulled Pork' burgers which were both excellent but decided against a desert in favour of another pint!!! Less than 50 euros for the two of us which I think is good value in France. Will go there again and we would both recommend it."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Positive,Great value for money!!,Mar 2016 •,"We visited here for a meal before we headed off to the England v France match. The place was buzzing! Packed with loads of England fans and Wales v Italy on the big screen. They serve their own beers and basic burgers. The food arrived quickly and was very tasty and good value. Very good service! It doesn't have any pretensions about it's food, it is what it is. If you want a tasty, well cooked burger at a reasonable price, this is the place!

Best part of the visit was explaining to the French waitress why all the England fans were cheering for Italy…..!! ;-)"
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Positive,Lively place,Feb 2016 •,"Nice area, great atmosphere, interesting choice of ales and good service. 
My only criticism is tables are too close together so you feel like sardines in a tin!"
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Positive,Great location,Feb 2016 •,"The Frog in Bercy village is a reasonably priced place serving american style food, great service, tables so close to each other but packed constantly, large indoor seating and outdoor seating with heaters etc. The cheapest bottle of win in France the whole time we were there at 20 euro's, just a pity it was a £4 Hardy's Australian Chardonnay"
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Positive,American food in bercy village,Feb 2016 •,"Decent food for a normal price in a touristique area. Burgers were OK, barbeque was good. Service was really friendly and helpfull. Bit crowded and noisy. Tried couple of homebrew Beers and they were good and unique. Would give 3,5 for food and price. But service and beer are worth a 4"
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Positive,Bercy Frog ++,Feb 2016 •,"good food,waiters nice and quick service.Great atmosphere and decoration ++ nice location,close the movie theatre"
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Positive,"Good food, decent pricing",Feb 2016 •,"We had the hamburger and fish and chips Both were decent potrtions. You can't get a medium rare hamburger in the States but you can in France. The fish was really good but only complaint is you only get one piece. Atmosphere is good, tables are crowded together, service was good."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Positive,Pleasant and charming,Feb 2015 •,"Nice, quirky little place in Bercy Village. Good range of beers and other drinks. Visited on a Thursday afternoon and was quite busy, can imagine it's close to bursting at the weekends. Friendly atmosphere and quite relaxed."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Positive,Great beer and food plus watched American Football,Jan 2016 •,"Great beer and food plus watched American Football. Leo our waiter was  awesome and very accommodating to us Americans, as well as the manager in putting on the big screen the playoff game between Minnesota and  Seattle. The beer was great as well as the food."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Positive,Drinks,Dec 2015 •,"Lovely atmosphere. Staff are on point, on the most part, though seemed to be very busy. Really nice place, nice location as well..."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Positive,Very attentive staff.,Nov 2015 •,"Aside from the food, this one is memorable for the exceptional service provided by their staff especially Laura. Very attentive. Even made a customized drink for me."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Positive,Excellent Beer but disappointing food,Nov 2015 •,"We came across The Frog by chance as we walked around Bercy Village after a stroll in the lovely Bercy Park that it backs on to. We were surprised to find a microbrewery in France so decided to try it. There was a good selection of beers that seemed to be brewed on the premises. The pale ale was excellent and certainly worth the visit.
However, we were feeling peckish and decided to order some food. The food selection was very much international pub food and we had the sharing plate. It consisted of prawns in batter, deep fried Camembert , and rather greasy nachos. Not something that made us want to try any of the other dishes so we had another beer and headed elsewhere to eat."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Positive,Burger restaurant with homebrewed beer,Nov 2015 •,"This is a place to go with friends, before or after going to the nearby movie theater. Young crowd, friendly service, nice burgers, homemade beer. I just wish they served the burgers on a plate, not on a pastic tray with a paper cover that shreds into pieces if you eat your burger with fork and knife."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Positive,Quick visit,Oct 2015 •,"I went there with some friends. The waiters were nice and quick. The drinks were good depending on personal taste. We didn't eat, so i cant review the food there. The decoration of the place is great. The atmosphere was good. The best thing was the humongous tv screen displaying a PSG soccer match that night."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Positive,Great craft beer pub in Bercy Village with good food,Oct 2015 •,"The Frog at Bercy Village is a great craft beer pub in Bercy Village serving their own fine brew!

It's great to find a craft beer pub when away with work that has a good selection of beers particularly when the pub brews it themselves. I highly recommend the Natural Blonde beer!

As well as sampling their fine beer I have also eaten in The Frog on a couple of occasions. The service has always been excellent even when very busy on a Friday night. I would highly recommend any of their burgers!

Overall a good place for good beer and good food."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Positive,Great experience but do not go just for the food,Mar 2015 •,"Offers basic British/America pub style food (burgers, etc.) and they also brew their own beer. Great fun with a group but can be noisy. This is the place to go if you want to eat/drink and watch sport on a big screen."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Positive,"Very nice ""watering hole"" !",Aug 2015 •,"What a superb bar and restaurant. Has it's own micro brewery and I particularly enjoyed a beer called ""FranceLYTIC"" ! Think about it, because a couple of these will see you in a very comfortable frame of mind. Sports type of bar as well so a lot going on. Great atmosphere particularly in the evening. Should be more places like this"
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Positive,Great Drinks,Oct 2015 •,"Drinks here at the end of a long day.  Very busy place but great to sit up at the bar, watch a bit of sports on the TV and great cocktails.  Great way to end a day of sightseeing.  I would have rated a bit higher, but it was so hot inside the venue, it was uncomfortable to stay any longer than 2 drinks."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Positive,The best in Bercy Village,Aug 2015 •,"A very nice pub in the Bercy Village, where you can have a great local beer. Just choose your beer style, ask for the big jar and share it with friends or your lover."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Positive,great burgers,Sept 2015 •,Try the pulled pork burger it is out of this world! They could add some variety to their beers Although what they had was good. Waiters need to be a bit more attentive.
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Positive,Tasty Beer,Sept 2015 •,Well worth a visit to the Microbrewery. Enjoyed a couple of pints of Blonde Beer and tried the Wham! Staff were helpful and friendly.
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Positive,Excellent beers and coctails,Sept 2015 •,"Our last night in France we visited there. The menu is in French but waiter translated for us.  Excelent beers and coctails. We ordered nachos, chicken wings, burgers. Everything was very tasty. Defenetly will visit thete again."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Positive,Quick lunch,Jul 2015 •,"The food and drinking are very good. I also found the micro-brewing operation very interesting, particularly as one of the staff members noticed me admiring the vats and talked me through their process. We liked it so much we went back in an evening just for drinks. Good crowd of locals and tourists."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Positive,Great meal,Aug 2015 •,Visited The Frog whilst stopping off in France on way home from south of France. Fabulous meal and staff couldn't have been more helpful. Really speedy service despite being run off their feet. Will definitely be visiting again next time we're in France !
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Positive,Great late night bar and food place...,Aug 2015 •,"We went to the Frog in Bercy village to grab some late night food and drink as it's open until 3am on a Saturday, the frog is a delightful pub chain and microbrewery, the staff are very pleasant, laid back and helpful and look like they are enjoying themselves. 

We sat outside in the terrase it's very cosy and a great atmosphere, shame you can't hear some of the great music playing inside.. 

The food is good gastro-pub food, and I had the haloumi burger, which was the vegetarian option.. Very delightful and tasty, a great choice. We were tempted by dessert but having seen how large they were declined..  And decided to stick to the rather large drinks menu that they have.

Later we headed inside to continue our evening and listen to the music.. Which the staff were enjoying as well.. It's a fun place to be in and in a great location in this old converted wine storage areas."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Positive,lovely food!,May 2015 •,Lovely food worth going to! Had the tortilla chips they were amazing and the chicken ceaser salad!! Not badly priced. The wifi is very poor though.
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Positive,GOOD GRUB & BEER,Aug 2015 •,"We where staying in the Ibis hotel opposite Bercy Village and wondered across one evening looking for something to eat 
we chose The Frog as hubby like's trying new beers and we could get something English to eat (i know boring !!lol) 
we sat outside as it was a warm evening & the Atmosphere was Perfect , hubby had a burger which he really enjoyed (& he eats alot of burgers) and i had fish& chips with minted mushy peas Yummy 
then hubby had a peanut butter stack & i had the oreo stack mmmmmmm yum yum

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Positive,Well priced food and great atmosphere,Aug 2015 •,This place in the heart of Bercy is alive and great fun. Our  waiter was fun to deal with coping with our broken French and his Italian with English in the middle. All the waiters seemed joyful and helpful. Worth another visit.
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Positive,Good Frog beer,Aug 2015 •,"Just had one beer there but it was a good one. It's from their microbrewery (Frog). We were outside but the place seem to have a big place inside. 

I didn't try their food, but they do have some. Pub style food."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Positive,Great beer,Aug 2015 •,"We only stopped for beers, so I can't comment on the food. The beer was really good. I had the Ginger Twist, and it was unlike any other Amber beer that I've tried before. You could really taste the lime. Hubby had the Maison Blanche. It was also a great patio to people watch. Would recommend to someone going to Bercy Village."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Positive,An evening drinks with friends/colleagues,Feb 2015 •,"Great place to spend an evening with nice cocktails, delicious snacks à la carte and big place for groups !! Have fun..."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Positive,Bonbon!,Jan 2015 •,Super place to eat in France that wont cost too much! Visited 2 yrs ago however i had forgotten its name and never left a review! Good value for money and great atmosphere!
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Positive,The beer place,Jul 2015 •,"Home brewed beer don't disappoint. They are also good at beer snacks from fried onions, chicken wings to burgers and salads. After 20 expect quite a crowd."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Positive,Home-made beer was quite delicious.,Jun 2015 •,"We were occuppying a table of 15 people. It was different from what I've encountered in other pubs in France. The service was much better, especially while dealing with large groups entering the pub. I was satisfied with the blond waitress Carol, who was very attentive and friendly. It would be nice to have more options on the menu, since it's such a big pub, but, for the time being, it's pretty cool."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Positive,Very good,Jun 2015 •,"Great bar in a great location with a fantastic buzz.. Go here! 
Good service and good value for a major city"
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Positive,Fish and Chips,May 2015 •,"A nice lunch in the sunshine, fish and chips were ""mostly authentic"" and crispy chicken burger was tasty.  Choice of wine could be wider, there's only 1 option for white (aussie chardonnay) and pink (cotes de provence). Serving staff were efficient and pleasant."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Positive,"British-Style Pub in the Pretty Bércy Quartier. Micro-Brewery, too!",Jun 2014 •,"Best of The Frog chain of British-style pubs in France (also in one of the prettiest parts of France, Bércy).

The Frog at Bércy Village is located very close to Bércy underground station (about a 1 minute walk). Bércy Village, actually, is a short secluded lane with restaurants and shops on either side, not really a village after all. Bércy is the actual quartier. Close by is one of the many wonderful France attractions, La Cinémathéque Francaise (see my review). One more reason to go there.

The Frog Bércy is the prettiest of a chain of 4 British-style Pubs in central France, it's also a microbrewery. Their ales are British style (IPA, best bitter, stout - plus a Hoegaarden like lemony ale), and of very good quality. Admittedly, the prices for these beers are € 5 and up, so effectively even more expensive than in London. But then, France is the rip-off to end all other rip-offs, and beer prices can go up to € 10 for 500ml (not even a pint!). € 5 per glass are called ""happy hour"" around here! It's not even a tourist rip-off, because the French are always happy to rip off their own countrymen, too, in one fell swoop.

I had a couple of fine real ales there and fish and chips (what else!). The portion wasn't huge, but to compensate for that, it was small. The fish was of excellent quality, crisp, with a good bite and firm texture - the chips were a bit flabby, just like the ones you get at many British pubs. Home, sweet [spiritual] home. ;)

The decor is very pleasant indeed, and emphasizes the ""dual"" British-French nature of the pub. Despite the slightly inflated prices, the pub is extremely busy at lunch *and* dinner times. Well, it's a nice neighborhood after all.

Service is decidedly French, i.e. a bit snooty, generally inefficient and a tad slow. It's all part of the folklore, isn't it?"
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Positive,Great as always,Dec 2014 •,"If you want to enjoy a beer and a burger in a British style pub, the Frog is the place to go. Their craft beer is great (try the Dark or the Inseine) and their food is really good. The waiters are also very pleasant and you can easily discuss with them (in English of course).

One of the best places for a few beers with friends or colleagues."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Positive,Fish and Chips with New York Cheesecake,Dec 2014 •,We had a great meal here of fish and chips and New York cheesecake. The place is so France and the toilets are clean.  The hamburgers looks huge and wonderful.
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Positive,Best Fish and Chips... and a place for beer snobs too!,Feb 2014 •,"I know, when you are in France, why would you want to eat at a British style pub?  Well... because the food is AMAZEBALLS!  

My husband and I came here one night, both hungry as we just walked about 10 miles through the city.  Ordered up the fish and chips, and they were the best fish and chips I have ever had!  We both agreed, this was the best food we had while we were in France. It was so good, that we went back again the next night for dinner.  

The other cool thing about this place, is that they have microbrews.  Now, where I come from, beer is a religion.  I am not a beer drinker, but my husband is and he brews his own.  Frogs has a great brewery set up and from what I heard, really good beer. 

So, if you want great fish and chips and an excellent beer - go here... you won't be disappointed!"
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Positive,"Amazing staff, good food!",Mar 2014 •,"The Frog was a go-to destination for me when I was in France. Good drinks, atmosphere and menu options as well as an excellent mix of French and English speaking waitstaff. Loved the burgers!"
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Positive,Great Pub,Dec 2014 •,Buzzing and great service with a good range of drinks. Possibly a little bit too much deep fat frying  but that seems to be the vogue for bar snacks these days!
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Positive,very good therefore very crowded,Dec 2014 •,"Very good place with big varieties of food options staff is nice, welcoming and speak good English you can hardly find a place inside but outside is nice and warm with the heater"
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Positive,great place to hang out after office hours,Nov 2014 •,"I went here with a friend after office hours, it was queuing that time, but we were quite lucky to get a seat after 5 min waiting.
The specialty from this restaurant is the beer, they have a lot of variance of local beer and also cocktail-beer
The food is average, its more to burger, chicken wings, etc, but you dont have to wait for long for the food to come."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Positive,Brews own beers!,Feb 2022 •,"This is a wonderful setting in Bercy Village (Cour St Emilion). Very authentic, very british! The staf is very friendly, even on an early sunday morning. 
Plates are delicious, tough 'real fresh belgian french fries' aren't the same as the real ones in Belgium. 
We took the brunch formula and was very tasteful! Prices are a little high."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Positive,Great Veggie Burgers!!,Aug 2014 •,"This was our first meal in Bercy and well worth the decision to eat there.  The food was excellent.  Not cheap but it is France in August so what you would expect!  The waiter was lovely, very friendly and accommodating.  Would definitely return AND it was the only place that had anything remotely vegetarian for my daughter :)"
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Positive,It's not bad,Feb 2022 •,Was a little slow to bring the beer out but the food is good and if you're a working Brit and need a beer and club sandwich it's OK.
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Positive,great burgers,Jan 2014 •,Good service and good food. Very good waiters helpful and polite. Went through the menu to make sure that we knew what it all was and what we would get.
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Positive,Nice break,Jan 2014 •,"It's a bar. They serve bar food (hamburger, nachos etc) so don't expect a fancy meal. But, the atmosphere is great, they got good beer and the food, although basic, is of good quality. Staff is very friendly. Be prepared for some wait at peak times and on weekends. It's a popular place for a reason."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Positive,Great home-brewed beers!,Jan 2014 •,"A range of excellent beers brewed on the premises, you are served a full pint (not 50cl) and during happy hour (mon-fri eves to 8.00pm) a pint costs € 5.00 (€ 6.50 at other times, but still great value for France!). Friendly atmosphere.  We visited twice and would have visited more often if time allowed."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Positive,Micro brewery pub,Jan 2014 •,This is a great British type pub that brews it's own beer which are excellent but pricey. The staff are very friendly and the food is good too. It was very busy on the Saturday night we visited with a good atmosphere and a young crowd and there is a big screen for all the sporting events.
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Positive,American burger and beer bar,Dec 2013 •,"A nice restaurant located in the Bercy Village.
Serves gourmet burgers and fries.
Several beers that are unique to the restaurant are served.
The restaurant offers a large menu and beverages but I have only enjoyed their burgers and fries and specialty beers.
The decor is bland, nothing special, cramped and loud. A bar food type feel to it.
But don't let this scare you away. This is a great place to get an American style burger, fries and beer."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Positive,"Lively, friendly, great beer",Feb 2022 •,"We were pleasantly surprised to see such a thriving venue mid week. We were served by a helpful, polite and friendly young man. We got a paddle of sample beers to make our choice before ordering a pint. (Pints aren't cheap in France). We ordered a couple of starters. The food was a good portion size & hot.  We would visit again to try a different beer and a main course!! Our moan would be no napkins and we ordered 'finger food'"
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Positive,Visit from Australia,Aug 2013 •,We had dinner at this restaurant/hotel & really enjoyed it. They brew their own beer & you can have a sample of all brewed. They bring it to you on a tray with 6 to try. Meal was enjoyable & we had a lovely young man that served us & looke dafter us for our evening out. Thank you .
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Positive,Best Burgers,Sept 2013 •,"Who goes to France and eats a burger at 10:30pm?  A person who is starving from touring all day.  Was the burger good, you ask?  Well, yeah..not just good but excellent.  Thank God, the French eat late and The Frog was brimming with people.  We were able to get our order in just before the kitchen closed thanks to Sandra, our waitress (she was attentive, fast and spoke good english ).  I thought the burger might have been that good because I was hungry.  I went back two nights later and the burger was excellent again.  What can you say about that?  Consistent and Excellent."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Positive,A gem!,Sept 2013 •,"We were amused at the thought of an ""English"" pub in the Franceian suburbs so went in to take a look.  We expected a tawdry, tacky version of an English pub but we were truly surprised.  It was a large establishment which you could enter from the park side or the ""village"" side.  On the first floor the coppers used for the brewery were gleaming.  The staff were fabulous and friendly and the menu looked like any pub menu but the quality of the food was excellent."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Positive,Welcome Respite,Aug 2013 •,"Like many other reviewers, we stopped here after a day of travelling and found it quite welcoming as the staff spoke excellent English and were extremely helpful. The selection of food and beverages was excellent as was the facilities and the mood music. I would definitely recoomend stopping here even if you're not hungry but just want a pint of fine beer."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Positive,friendly service,Aug 2013 •,we dined here on our first night in France following a day of travelling and we chose The Frog from all the restaurants in Bercy village as the staff were very helpful especially when it came to choosing from the menu and translating some of the items.  There was a nice atmosphere and even though the Frog was very busy we didnt have to wait too long for our meal to arrive and the meal was very nice. We had fish; chicken salad; chicken bacon wraps.  All good
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Positive,"Hot and Thirsty, have a pint here.",Aug 2013 •,"After several hours of walking through the streets of East France, this pub is a welcome relief.  One of the best cheeseburgers in France."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Positive,Good atmosphere ideal for families,Aug 2013 •,"Nice safe area , pedestrian only cobbled street with lots of hussle and bustle , food good , service ok but does get busy as a typical lively area. Is a safe bet with kids ."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Positive,"Nice atmosphere, Good food!",Dec 2012 •,"Wen't in initially as it was one of the few restaurants with english menus! The food was amazing, we even went back a few days later for cocktails, happy birthday to me!"
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Positive,Evening Meal at The Frog,Jun 2013 •,"An attempt on an English Style pub.
Very good food they specalise in the 'Frog' beefburgers 100% beef. Very good and reasonable price.
If you are in a group and would like a beer, try their own brew Blonde. 22 euros a jug of 4 pints, savig 4 euros."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Positive,Kicks Wetherspoons into touch!,Mar 2013 •,"This is not your typical little French Bistro or Patisserie. It's more like the French version of Wetherspoons but with far better food and service. We are a family of two adults and two children and were accommodated straight away on a busy Saturday night in France. There is a lively and bustling ( but non intimidatory) atmosphere at The Frog and the service was completely excellent. The waiters and waitresses are extremely busy but always have time for you and are always smiling and polite. One dark haired waitress had the type of smile that super models would die for! We didn't have to wait long for food. We had 2 x nachos for starters - excellent, good to see them being served with jalapeños as well- and 4 x various burgers ( inc. veggie ) for main meals. Again, could not fault these either. Basically, had a very good night at The Frog.

Beers, excellent and there was a really good choice.

Don't expect Bistro type drinks or food as this, as mentioned earlier, is a French type of Wetherspoons. The main difference though is excellent waiters, better beers, better food , better clientele and a superior atmosphere. No rowdiness, bad language or obese underdressed hen party- goers. Funny how they can get it right in the continent? The place is huge yet we never felt crowded. If in Bercy Village then The Frog has to be a must try place. Highly recommended is The Frog. Thanks for a lovely and relaxing evening."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Positive,What a wonderful pub in France!,Feb 2022 •,"Nice, large-sized microbrewery restaurant. Nice selection of house beers. Staff are really friendly. Great food, great beer!"
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Positive,Nice beer in France,Mar 2013 •,"I prefer beer to wine, so this little oasis was a great find.  The food comes in decent portions, and it's definitely pub-grub, rather than restaurant fare."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Positive,Lovely dinner experience!,Feb 2022 •,"The frog is in bercy village just in frot of the entrance to ketro station cour st.emilion... Lovely atmospere, frendly staff that speak english, home made beers of all kinds and cool selectiob of food.

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Positive,Excellent Food and Service,Sept 2012 •,"Whilst staying in the Bercy Pullman for 3 nights, we went to the Frog Pub twice, the food was excellent and the service was very friendly and most of the staff speak good english. I was with my 2 year old and they gave him some crayons and paper to keep him entertained, which was great for me. The food was reasonably priced for France. I would definately go back to this pub."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Positive,Innovative Pub off the beaten track,Feb 2022 •,"Very lovely pub in Bercy village, located in a former Train Station. The beer they are brewing on location is delicious and a pint costs a mere € 6.50 which is cheap in France."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Positive,Fast Food with a Flair,Apr 2012 •,"We were delighted to find that our waiter spoke American English and helpfully described the menue.The place was quite noisy and crowded but service was fast and the food was good,especially the fish and french fries that I had. My husband enjoyed the Micro brewed beer that apparently is made in house..Prices are high by American standards but this is true all over France and they did take Visa."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Positive,Hot Frog,Mar 2012 •,"The food is lovely, well the stuff we had was anyway (crispy chicken).  The beer brewed in the micro-brewery is also superb, but it was incredibly warm inside when we visited."
France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Positive,Good bar for a few beers,Mar 2012 •,"The bar has a mix of its own brand lagers, which were a bit different. There was a ginger style one that I enjoyed! The bar has a young crowd, and was easily the busiest place in Bercy Village for a drink. I would check it out if you are in the area."

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Positive,Très bien,Jun 2024 •,"Très bonne soirée un soir de match de l'équipe de France (21 juin 2024), la réservation  a bien été prise en compte. Il faisait juste très chaud dans le bar, alors qu'il ne faisait pas encore de grosses températures à l'extérieur. Une climatisation serait idéale."

Lieu fréquenté de temps à autre depuis de nombreuses années c est devenu un classique, la qualité  n à pas baissé  et les prix sont corrects.  Je recommande pour ce genre d ambiance."

Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Negative,This place lacks human decency,Sept 2011 •,"My husband and I are in Rome for our honeymoon and read up on Ad Hoc thinking it would be a nice treat. I made the reservations online and was accepted instantly. We showed up last night at 8pm all dressed up for our reservation when the woman kept going to the back of the restaurant looking it up again while seating other people. The restaurant at this point was empty and stayed that way at least to 8:15pm. It turns out in human error on my part after visiting 3 cities in 10 days I made the reservation for tonight at 8pm instead of last night. They refused to seat us! I ask nicely telling them we are on our honeymoon and all they said was 'so sorry' and escorted us to the door as if we were trying to break in. There was no manager (that I was aware of in sight) as I can't imagine they'd let this behavoir take place. I would also like to add that it was about 85 degrees last night and this place has NO AIR CONDITIONING. A part of us were relieved to not have to eat in that smoltering heat.
After eating a very lovely meal up the street (there are tons of great places to choose from). My husband wanted to walk by Ad Hoc to see if they were 'completely booked'. Although they were more crowded they definitely could have accommodated us. We're from NYC and I honestly could never see this happening there regardless of who made the error. I'm sure this review won't affect anyones desire to try this place, but hopefully it will affect the way their staff treats people."
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Negative,Stay clear of this place!,Feb 2022 •,"After a 10 day vacation in Italy we wanted to have a really special meal for the last evening (allthough I must admit our holiday was full of special meals...). Having passed the restaurant earlier in the afternoon my husband really liked the interior, and I liked that they had lobster w honeyglazed lemon on the menue, so we decided to eat there if they had a free table for us. Returning later in the evening we were greeted by a very friendly waitress and yes, they had room for us. Plenty of empty tables that evening actually (Sunday Nov. 7). Since we had been really overeating the whole trip, and I hadn´t read any reviews on this restaurant, we decided to just go for the ""secondi piatti"" and skip the antipasti. Well, good for us that we did. We did get the complementary sparkling white whine, and then went for the lobster on my part, and four try-out meat-courses for hubby.  I agree with others, the servings were really small, and our consolation in that respect was that we were in need of dieting anyway. Plates were cold, sucking the warmth out of the food. My lobster was pieces of lobster served on a square of cold, dry rice. Lobster was ok, as the strings of honey-glazed lemons. As a side order we had green asparagus with parmeggiano cheese; the asparagus wasn´t quite done so hard to chew, and the parmeggiano? Well, I am no expert, but it tasted like generic if there is such a thing when it comes to parmeggiano. Dry and tasteless! My husband's glass of wine was more like one fourth glass, and measured digitally, mind you! We wew served a basket of bread with the food without asking for it, and really didn´t touch it, but lo and behold: they charged us for the bread!!! Not even in the cheapest joint! But here, oh yes, and 3 € it was! By the time we were actually finished and served the bill by the ever-sweet waitress and noticed this we could only laugh! Thank God for speaking an unusual language (Swedish) and being able to laugh and comment on this experience at the spot.  The whole time a v ery unpleasant unsmiling man (the owner?) kept lurching in and out from the back of the restaurant. At one point one of teh waitresses seemed to try to cheer him up a bit by wrapping herself intimately around him in the back room behind our table (my seating position made it impossible for me not to notice), but to no avail. He remained very serous end stern. Everytime one of the waitresses received money from a guest he popped out to take it and check the bill, so strange, and it semed our waitress was a bit uncomfortable with this. If so eager, why didn´t he do the charging himself? All in all, a total flop for the prices they charge. There are so many other good restaurants in Rome, so do avoid this one !"

Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Negative,SHAMEFUL,Feb 2022 •,"It was just a SHAME!

We waited for our starters for almost one hour! Just because they told us they were cutting by hand our Salumi, including Serrano Ham. I come from Spain, where, in quarter an hour you can have at least 6 traies of fresh-cut serrano ham!!! and when we told tthe waitress how slow they were she replied as if we where the guilty ones who had chosen that starter and knew how long it took it to prepare it! (on top of that the ham wasn`t even good)
Moreover it took us half an hour to have the bill!!
For God`s sake! I really encourage you not to go there!!!"
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Negative,disappointing - after reading such great reviews,Feb 2022 •,"I was in Rome this weekend and i had booked a table here 2 weeks prior to me arriving.
Their website stated that you would be welcomed with a glass of Prosecco (f.o.c), well we were not.
We were put at a table and left, then the waitress came back and asked if we would like some water. We were then left alone again.
While we were sat waiting for the menu and wine menu, we had an Italian couple come and sit next to us. Within seconds they had 2 glasses of Prosecco and all the menus they could ask for.
When the waitress returned she gave us our menu and said she would be back in 5, (we had been there for 20 mins) to take our order. At this point i decided not to stay and when the waitress returned i said could we pay for the water, and we were leaving.
When she asked why i stated that it was because i felt as if i had been treated like an idiot. Stating that thier website says they offer a free glass of Prosecco as a welcome gift, and we hadnt recieved one (when the couple on the next table did), she said that it was not a problem and offered to get us a glass, but that wasnt the point. I also said that we hadnt been given a menu for a while and i just felt that because i wasnt Italian that i was being treated unfairly ...... ( I happen to have proposed to my girlfriend earlier on in the day and was really looking forward to a lovely meal) which we did have elsewhere.
Sorry to be a bummer but i was gutted.."
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Negative,Ad Hoc - yes some of the details of this restaurant are ad hoc,Feb 2022 •,We had a fab break in Rome for my 40th; the meal at Glass Hostaria was a highlight and we hoped for the same the following night at Ad Hoc as we'd read so many good reviews but it failed to reach our expectations. The maitre d'/sommelier seemed knowledgable and efficient but the dishes just did not deliver; I had the sea bass which had been taken off the bone badly so I was fishing out needle bones all through the meal and the nice potatoes they served with it were cold. My husband had a steak which was fine and a side order of fried potatoes which turned out to be frozen chips! We waited 40 minutes for the bill and I don't think for a bill of over £120 frozen anything is acceptable.
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Negative,“Ad hoc” rudeness!,Jun 2024 •,"“Ad hoc” rudeness!!!
Terrible restaurant, rude and presumptuous staff!!! Poor food with portions of a starred restaurant even if it doesn't have any stars! Not recommended especially for foreign tourists!"
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Negative,How not to be disappointed?,May 2024 •,"It was presented to us as one of the best Roman restaurants.
But had it not been for the setting, with so many beautiful bottles on the walls, and the kindness of the service, there was nothing but disappointment on the plate, whether it was the zucchini flowers with ricotta or the fresh pasta with summer truffles, tasteless and spoiled by the presence of useless grass. We will salute the Ornellaia which allowed us to dine on a more festive note."
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Negative,Overrated and touristy,Mar 2024 •,"Unfortunately the food was just average. No dish was really convincing. The greeting from the kitchen was okay but not a highlight in terms of taste.

The tartare had a bland taste and relied on the fact that it was served with truffles. The artichoke stuffed with yarn didn't actually taste like anything.

The carbonara tasted good but was a bit too salty.

Unfortunately, the desserts were completely ill-thought out. I had mine returned too.

All dishes lack that certain something.

The wine list was great. Unfortunately the selection of open wines was not good."
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Negative,Bad tasting food difficult to digest,Oct 2023 •,"We didn't like the food that much.

The starters were tasteless

and hard to digest.

The pasta was nothing special.

The main course was cooked for too long.

The dessert was too creamy.

Overall, the food was nice to look at

but lacked finesse in terms of taste.

We didn't like the food at all and therefore had a restless night"
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Negative,Pretty dissappointing.,Feb 2022 •,"I actually never write reviews for the restaurants, but for this one i just had to. The reason we decided to check this place out was only because of high ratings  on TA. I am still dissapointed about the choice we've made.Our dinner at this place was...well the right word for it would be BLAH... We have always dined at such wonderful places when visiting Rome before Ad Hoc. The atmosphere was very average and the way they seated people made it more uncomfortable. Do not even think to dress up for this one( even you think u r in Italy) it is very casual and reminded me of a coffee shop. I don't have anything bad to say about the service at our table, but nothing good either! They are really big on truffles on the menu, but that evening they were out of lots of things, so we did not have a lot to choose from.  The wine list is great tho. I did not see any managers on the floor, but the grumpy eastern European  looking man was very noticeable so as an owefully loud woman who was given the recipes to the guests next to us throughout our entire dinner. She was an employee or  my thought an owner and she was  really  loud to the point that I wanted to ask her to tune it down a little. Food was eatable and nothing to write home about till I got the cream brûlée. Instead of a nice and chilled on the inside and brown and crispy on the top I got Hot plate with Sprinckled  sugar on top.... My guess they just put it in the microwave instead of doing it the right way!!! Of course I didn't it touch it and we asked or the check. But no one even asked if something was wrong with it.  We did not complaint and just wanted to forget about an owefull experience , but the top position on TA list of restaurants in Rome is just making me sad again."
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Negative,Sorry,Feb 2012 •,"I'm afraid we were very let down by this restaurant.
We were left standing at the door for 5 minutes before being seated. We decided on the tasting menu for Land with wine. Although given a glass of prosecco when we were shown to our table, it took 35 minutes before we were served any food. 
Asparagus Roulade was overcooked.
Ravioli with Rabbit Ragout was very salty.
Ad Hoc Gnocchi were hard in the corners and I could have made a better sugo.
Saltimbocca alla Romana tasted like reconstituted meat in a roll.
Tiramisu was waterery and tasteless.
The service was fauning and pretentious.
Although I left alot on my plate uneaten I was never asked why until the dessert.
And finally as we were leaving we were given a cheap bottle of Spumante in a brown paper bag to take away. Why?
The only positive was that the wines were good.
All of this took almost 4 hours.
Would I recommend this restaurant? Absolutely not. Don't waste your time and money. There are far better places to eat in Rome."
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Negative,rotten starter - no apology. otherwise ok albeit overpriced,Dec 2011 •,"10 of us ate on christmas day at Ad Hoc - we were seated in a seperate area which initally we thought would be good but ended up meaning we were ignored. One of our startes came and as we cut into the pasta dumping it was clear it was rotten (rotten fish is fairly easy to detect) we asked the waitress and she removed the plate without saying anything. our main courses came and they brought another of the starter, now without rotten crab inside but fairly empty because of it - still no apology. my aunt had eaten a piece before realising anything was wrong and was pretty upset about it.
the rest of the meal was ok but very expensive and the service continued to be pretty patchy. we werent offered anything off the bill or a dessert to say sorry - really disappointed"
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Negative,Overrated. Bad service.,Dec 2011 •,"We walked in with a ressie to an empty restaurant, but for one couple. They jammed us in corner next to them, so we asked to move. She said she ""had to check""! It was absurd. They moved us begrudgingly, and we watched 3 couples get the same treatment. We did not like our food, and were disappointed."
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Negative,"Very slow, average food, lack of wine, totally over-priced",Dec 2011 •,"Visited Ad Hoc for NYE with my husband and was very disappointed with the evening. It was a set menu with wine pairings for a set price of 190 Euros EACH. We arrived at 8pm and we're greeted with a small glass of prosecco, a nice touch but we then waited 1 hour for our starter and our first glass of wine. The starter was very average. We then waited 2 hours for our main and we we still hadn't had a wine refill so in the end we had to ask the waitress if we could purchase additional wine. The waitress gave us a refill but the fact we had to ask and had had 1 glass of prosecco and 1 glass of wine in 3 hours was just not good enough. The two couples next to us also asked for more wine.  One lady was literally falling asleep at the table. Two other couples were ordering espresso which we assumed was to help them to stay awake.  The main was again very average and cold. The 'sea' menu was mainly just deep fried fish and sea food. We complained again about the time it was taking and the fact that we had been without wine for a further 30 minutes (at least).  The atmosphere was awful and very flat as everyone was so frustrated and had only had 3 glasses of wine all evening so the New Year came and went without many people noticing. The couple next to us were still waiting to be served their main meal after midnight.  We had to complain twice about the time it was taking and the lack of wine which ruined the evening completely as we are not the complaining types. Overall the service was average and very, very slow, at 380 Euros for two it was completely and utterly over priced as the food at best was very average.  We believe the Ad Hoc tasting menu with wine is normally 70 Euros and I think hiking the price up to 190 Euros per person was a mistake as the food, service did not live up to the price. We have eaten at many nice restaurants and would have expected a lot more for a NYE meal for the price they charged. We wish we had popped into a local Trattoria and enjoyed the fireworks and atmosphere in the Pizazza del Popolo. Incidentally, we had planned to watch the fireworks in the Piazza del Popolo but missed them due to the fact that the meal in the end took 5 hours! A very, very disappointing evening."
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Negative,Poor service,Nov 2011 •,"I can't comment on the food but the service was below par. We didn't have a reservation but it was still on the early side of dinner time. The restaurant had plenty of open tables however we were told they were full. When we asked about a reservation the next night we were told they were full for the next 2 nights, all this without looking at a reservation log book.
Needless to say we didn't try to dine here again."
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Negative,Unfortunately disappointing,Oct 2011 •,"We reserved a table through the website. This was very comfortable. We received a receipt. The atmorphere of the restaurant is very nice. The waitresses are very friendly, too. But it took very long until we could order. The gave us a complementary glas of prosecco. Overall the food was not really good except for the fettucine with truffels. The main course with meat was not good at all. We returned it to the kitchen. Overall the meal took 3.5 hours which was a lot of waiting. The restaurant was far too expensive for the value. After all the nice food we had in Rome in the small simple restaurants I would not go there again."
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Negative,Rude and inflexible,Oct 2011 •,"We had a reservation for 4 people, but was joined by a 5th at the last minute. As this was a child we hoped this would not be a problem. This couldn't have been further from the truth. 

The lady that dealt with us could not have been less helpful, in fact she was bordering on rude and aggressive. If our request for an extra chair at the end of a table for 4 was so difficult for a restaurant to handle, fair enough, but at least decline our request in a polite, professional manner... Sadly not the case at Ad Hoc."
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Negative,Absolutely not best in Rome - Would not return,Oct 2011 •,"With much anticipation we arrived for our reservation.  We were promptly seated, but then the trouble started.  It took nearly an hour for our order to be taken.  Sadly they were out of many menu items, including some featured in the hailed tasting menus.  Our dinner took nearly 4 hours with painfully slow service and most of the time with empty water and wine glasses.  Servers were completely inattentive.  I sensed that the entire dining room was annoyed with the poor service.  Food was OK, but several items on our tasting menu were cold and inedible.  Please save yourself the time and money.  There is absolutely no way that this is the best place in Rome."
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Negative,Expected the TA rating's and I was disapointed,Feb 2022 •,"Walked in and didn't get in, so made a reservation, confirmed thru e-mail. Arrived on time and they made us feel unwelcomed likethere was no reservation an after all they gave us a terrible table. Next to the waiters station. (never accept that table). They where out of squid and truffle as a welcome. But surprise 50% of the menu had truffle. I asked for help with the wine list. And never got help from the maitre'd and even approached our table. Would never go back."
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Negative,expensive rubbish,Sept 2011 •,"it took nearly 5 hours for them to complete our meal. They forgot to process our main course!!! Even our coffee took 30mins to arrive. What did they do go to brazil to pick the beans themselves. All this cost us 228€ for 2 of us. The food when it did arrive was average. Not to be recommended, look for where the locals go because it's not here!"
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Negative,A boring four and a half hours that could have been superb,Oct 2011 •,"We arrived at 08.15 with table booked for 08.30. No problem, made to feel very welcome. Problems started after first course.... I do not think the kitchen was able to cope with the meal orders..... seriously it took them four and a half hours to serve us our meal. The waitresses kept on apologising saying 'would not be long', 'working on yours now', 'yours is next to be cooked', etc.......
I think this is about the only restaurant I have left without leaving a tip.
It could have been superb if the kitchen timing was sorted, but the speed of non service spolit everything."
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Negative,How can this be the no. 1 restaurant in Rome ???,Oct 2011 •,"There wasn't one Italian person in this place. Only tourist, who like ourselves, read the reviews on tripadvisor and decided to venture there.
While the service was kind (but as the crowd, not local), the food was over trying and disappointing. Nothing close to the traditionally simple and qualitative cuisine you expect in Italy. 
DON'T GO THERE !!!"
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Negative,lost the touch,Oct 2011 •,"We went there for all the good critics here in tripadvisor, but sadly service was terrible and ambience was boring and 1 hour to serve the appetaizer and one more for the entre. food was ok and the waitress try to be nice but not enough. wouldn´t repit."

I also said that we hadnt been given a menu for a while and i just felt that because i wasnt Italian that i was being treated unfairly ...... ( I happen to have proposed to my girlfriend earlier on in the day and was really looking forward to a lovely meal) which we did have elsewhere.
Sorry to be a bummer but i was gutted.."
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Negative,Ad Hoc - yes some of the details of this restaurant are ad hoc,Feb 2022 •,We had a fab break in Rome for my 40th; the meal at Glass Hostaria was a highlight and we hoped for the same the following night at Ad Hoc as we'd read so many good reviews but it failed to reach our expectations. The maitre d'/sommelier seemed knowledgable and efficient but the dishes just did not deliver; I had the sea bass which had been taken off the bone badly so I was fishing out needle bones all through the meal and the nice potatoes they served with it were cold. My husband had a steak which was fine and a side order of fried potatoes which turned out to be frozen chips! We waited 40 minutes for the bill and I don't think for a bill of over £120 frozen anything is acceptable.
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Negative,How not to be disappointed?,May 2024 •,"It was presented to us as one of the best Roman restaurants.
But had it not been for the setting, with so many beautiful bottles on the walls, and the kindness of the service, there was nothing but disappointment on the plate, whether it was the zucchini flowers with ricotta or the fresh pasta with summer truffles, tasteless and spoiled by the presence of useless grass. We will salute the Ornellaia which allowed us to dine on a more festive note."
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Negative,Bad tasting food difficult to digest,Oct 2023 •,"We didn't like the food that much.

The starters were tasteless

and hard to digest.

The pasta was nothing special.

The main course was cooked for too long.

The dessert was too creamy.

Overall, the food was nice to look at

but lacked finesse in terms of taste.

We didn't like the food at all and therefore had a restless night"
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Negative,Pretty dissappointing.,Feb 2022 •,"I actually never write reviews for the restaurants, but for this one i just had to. The reason we decided to check this place out was only because of high ratings  on TA. I am still dissapointed about the choice we've made.Our dinner at this place was...well the right word for it would be BLAH... We have always dined at such wonderful places when visiting Rome before Ad Hoc. The atmosphere was very average and the way they seated people made it more uncomfortable. Do not even think to dress up for this one( even you think u r in Italy) it is very casual and reminded me of a coffee shop. I don't have anything bad to say about the service at our table, but nothing good either! They are really big on truffles on the menu, but that evening they were out of lots of things, so we did not have a lot to choose from.  The wine list is great tho. I did not see any managers on the floor, but the grumpy eastern European  looking man was very noticeable so as an owefully loud woman who was given the recipes to the guests next to us throughout our entire dinner. She was an employee or  my thought an owner and she was  really  loud to the point that I wanted to ask her to tune it down a little. Food was eatable and nothing to write home about till I got the cream brûlée. Instead of a nice and chilled on the inside and brown and crispy on the top I got Hot plate with Sprinckled  sugar on top.... My guess they just put it in the microwave instead of doing it the right way!!! Of course I didn't it touch it and we asked or the check. But no one even asked if something was wrong with it.  We did not complaint and just wanted to forget about an owefull experience , but the top position on TA list of restaurants in Rome is just making me sad again."
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Negative,Sorry,Feb 2012 •,"I'm afraid we were very let down by this restaurant.
We were left standing at the door for 5 minutes before being seated. We decided on the tasting menu for Land with wine. Although given a glass of prosecco when we were shown to our table, it took 35 minutes before we were served any food. 
Asparagus Roulade was overcooked.
Ravioli with Rabbit Ragout was very salty.
Ad Hoc Gnocchi were hard in the corners and I could have made a better sugo.
Saltimbocca alla Romana tasted like reconstituted meat in a roll.
Tiramisu was waterery and tasteless.
The service was fauning and pretentious.
Although I left alot on my plate uneaten I was never asked why until the dessert.
And finally as we were leaving we were given a cheap bottle of Spumante in a brown paper bag to take away. Why?
The only positive was that the wines were good.
All of this took almost 4 hours.
Would I recommend this restaurant? Absolutely not. Don't waste your time and money. There are far better places to eat in Rome."
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Negative,rotten starter - no apology. otherwise ok albeit overpriced,Dec 2011 •,"10 of us ate on christmas day at Ad Hoc - we were seated in a seperate area which initally we thought would be good but ended up meaning we were ignored. One of our startes came and as we cut into the pasta dumping it was clear it was rotten (rotten fish is fairly easy to detect) we asked the waitress and she removed the plate without saying anything. our main courses came and they brought another of the starter, now without rotten crab inside but fairly empty because of it - still no apology. my aunt had eaten a piece before realising anything was wrong and was pretty upset about it.
the rest of the meal was ok but very expensive and the service continued to be pretty patchy. we werent offered anything off the bill or a dessert to say sorry - really disappointed"
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Negative,Overrated. Bad service.,Dec 2011 •,"We walked in with a ressie to an empty restaurant, but for one couple. They jammed us in corner next to them, so we asked to move. She said she ""had to check""! It was absurd. They moved us begrudgingly, and we watched 3 couples get the same treatment. We did not like our food, and were disappointed."
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Negative,"Very slow, average food, lack of wine, totally over-priced",Dec 2011 •,"Visited Ad Hoc for NYE with my husband and was very disappointed with the evening. It was a set menu with wine pairings for a set price of 190 Euros EACH. We arrived at 8pm and we're greeted with a small glass of prosecco, a nice touch but we then waited 1 hour for our starter and our first glass of wine. The starter was very average. We then waited 2 hours for our main and we we still hadn't had a wine refill so in the end we had to ask the waitress if we could purchase additional wine. The waitress gave us a refill but the fact we had to ask and had had 1 glass of prosecco and 1 glass of wine in 3 hours was just not good enough. The two couples next to us also asked for more wine.  One lady was literally falling asleep at the table. Two other couples were ordering espresso which we assumed was to help them to stay awake.  The main was again very average and cold. The 'sea' menu was mainly just deep fried fish and sea food. We complained again about the time it was taking and the fact that we had been without wine for a further 30 minutes (at least).  The atmosphere was awful and very flat as everyone was so frustrated and had only had 3 glasses of wine all evening so the New Year came and went without many people noticing. The couple next to us were still waiting to be served their main meal after midnight.  We had to complain twice about the time it was taking and the lack of wine which ruined the evening completely as we are not the complaining types. Overall the service was average and very, very slow, at 380 Euros for two it was completely and utterly over priced as the food at best was very average.  We believe the Ad Hoc tasting menu with wine is normally 70 Euros and I think hiking the price up to 190 Euros per person was a mistake as the food, service did not live up to the price. We have eaten at many nice restaurants and would have expected a lot more for a NYE meal for the price they charged. We wish we had popped into a local Trattoria and enjoyed the fireworks and atmosphere in the Pizazza del Popolo. Incidentally, we had planned to watch the fireworks in the Piazza del Popolo but missed them due to the fact that the meal in the end took 5 hours! A very, very disappointing evening."
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Negative,Poor service,Nov 2011 •,"I can't comment on the food but the service was below par. We didn't have a reservation but it was still on the early side of dinner time. The restaurant had plenty of open tables however we were told they were full. When we asked about a reservation the next night we were told they were full for the next 2 nights, all this without looking at a reservation log book.
Needless to say we didn't try to dine here again."
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Negative,Unfortunately disappointing,Oct 2011 •,"We reserved a table through the website. This was very comfortable. We received a receipt. The atmorphere of the restaurant is very nice. The waitresses are very friendly, too. But it took very long until we could order. The gave us a complementary glas of prosecco. Overall the food was not really good except for the fettucine with truffels. The main course with meat was not good at all. We returned it to the kitchen. Overall the meal took 3.5 hours which was a lot of waiting. The restaurant was far too expensive for the value. After all the nice food we had in Rome in the small simple restaurants I would not go there again."
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Negative,Rude and inflexible,Oct 2011 •,"We had a reservation for 4 people, but was joined by a 5th at the last minute. As this was a child we hoped this would not be a problem. This couldn't have been further from the truth. 

The lady that dealt with us could not have been less helpful, in fact she was bordering on rude and aggressive. If our request for an extra chair at the end of a table for 4 was so difficult for a restaurant to handle, fair enough, but at least decline our request in a polite, professional manner... Sadly not the case at Ad Hoc."
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Negative,Absolutely not best in Rome - Would not return,Oct 2011 •,"With much anticipation we arrived for our reservation.  We were promptly seated, but then the trouble started.  It took nearly an hour for our order to be taken.  Sadly they were out of many menu items, including some featured in the hailed tasting menus.  Our dinner took nearly 4 hours with painfully slow service and most of the time with empty water and wine glasses.  Servers were completely inattentive.  I sensed that the entire dining room was annoyed with the poor service.  Food was OK, but several items on our tasting menu were cold and inedible.  Please save yourself the time and money.  There is absolutely no way that this is the best place in Rome."
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Negative,Expected the TA rating's and I was disapointed,Feb 2022 •,"Walked in and didn't get in, so made a reservation, confirmed thru e-mail. Arrived on time and they made us feel unwelcomed likethere was no reservation an after all they gave us a terrible table. Next to the waiters station. (never accept that table). They where out of squid and truffle as a welcome. But surprise 50% of the menu had truffle. I asked for help with the wine list. And never got help from the maitre'd and even approached our table. Would never go back."
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Negative,expensive rubbish,Sept 2011 •,"it took nearly 5 hours for them to complete our meal. They forgot to process our main course!!! Even our coffee took 30mins to arrive. What did they do go to brazil to pick the beans themselves. All this cost us 228€ for 2 of us. The food when it did arrive was average. Not to be recommended, look for where the locals go because it's not here!"
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Negative,A boring four and a half hours that could have been superb,Oct 2011 •,"We arrived at 08.15 with table booked for 08.30. No problem, made to feel very welcome. Problems started after first course.... I do not think the kitchen was able to cope with the meal orders..... seriously it took them four and a half hours to serve us our meal. The waitresses kept on apologising saying 'would not be long', 'working on yours now', 'yours is next to be cooked', etc.......
I think this is about the only restaurant I have left without leaving a tip.
It could have been superb if the kitchen timing was sorted, but the speed of non service spolit everything."
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Negative,How can this be the no. 1 restaurant in Rome ???,Oct 2011 •,"There wasn't one Italian person in this place. Only tourist, who like ourselves, read the reviews on tripadvisor and decided to venture there.
While the service was kind (but as the crowd, not local), the food was over trying and disappointing. Nothing close to the traditionally simple and qualitative cuisine you expect in Italy. 
DON'T GO THERE !!!"
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Negative,lost the touch,Oct 2011 •,"We went there for all the good critics here in tripadvisor, but sadly service was terrible and ambience was boring and 1 hour to serve the appetaizer and one more for the entre. food was ok and the waitress try to be nice but not enough. wouldn´t repit."
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Negative,TERRIBLE ATTITUDE!!!!DONT GO!!!!,Oct 2011 •,Terrible attitude as soon as walked in!!! Who do they think they are???
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Birthday Dinner,Jan 2020 •,Ad Hoc was the PERFECT place to celebrate my birthday. They made the entire dining experience so special and continued to bring out special treats throughout the meal. The entire waitstaff was attentive and made us feel at home. Their wine list is extensive and the staff was fantastic at narrowing down and helping us find a wine we could all enjoy. Would highly recommend the dining experience here for anyone looking for an incredible meal in Rome.
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Great Italian cooking with a touch,Jan 2020 •,"It was the second time I ate at Ad Hoc, after a few years. Food is still great, Italian with a modern touch. Good and friendly service. Huge selection of good wines.
The place is cosy enough for a romantic dinner or a small group appreciating clever cooking."
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,One of the best meals in Italy,Oct 2019 •,"You want to be treated like royalty while paying for normal fine dining? This is the place. And the food is wonderful. Lots of complimentary small bites to make this worthy of a Michelin star. Seriously, give this place a try. I think you will love the whole experience."
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Phenomenal,Oct 2019 •,"I could not recommend this restaurant more. I spent one month in Rome and this was HANDS DOWN the best food I had the entire time I was there. The atmosphere was 10/10, a candlelit, romantic setting, which from my experience was quite rare in the brightly lit Italian restaurants. Having said that the main highlight was the food which was exceptional even by Italian standards. Also the staff were wonderful and they even sent a cookbook of recipes, truffle and wine information. I was just blown away with the experience and could not recommend it more to locals and tourist alike"
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Great food and service,Jan 2020 •,The food was good. The wine selection and service were excellent. The restaurant is very cute with a warm and cozy feel to it.
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Excellent atmosphere and service!,Jan 2020 •,"If you want to really enjoy in food and service I highly reccomend Ad Hoc restaurant. Outsanding service, great wine list, great starters and pasta with white or black truffles. Lamb as a main course was excellent and also the desserts. At the end they have a present for every guest, small bottle of extra vergin olive oil. Very nice gesture!"
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,wonderful  & accomodating,Jan 2020 •,"we showed up on a Saturday night without a reservation, but a late cancellation proved fortuitous.   My wife and I took our daughter and wanted to give her a special night before she started her school.  Though we ate only a few courses off the ala carte menu, the staff did a wonderful job and made my daughter feel special including a gift of a some olive oil at the end of the night.   A wine substitution of an out of stock bottle was spot on and the service was impeccable. 
Wonderful"
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Very tasty!!!,Jan 2020 •,Highly recommend this place. Pasta with truffles is incredible! Wine list is in two books! Starters are great!!!
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,"Great food, excellent wine, inviting atmosphere &  outstanding service",Oct 2019 •,"If you want a restaurant experience that captures all of the good things about Italy in general and Rome in particular you must visit Ad Hoc. The restautant surrounds you with fine food and wine on the shelves while the service is efficient but unhurried. However, the highlight, as in any good restaurant, is the food and wine you are served. Simply exceptional."
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Michelin must come for a visit,Oct 2019 •,Fantastic food and wine. Exellent service. The atmosphere were calm and quiet. Tidy and clean restrooms.
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,"Excellent food , wine and service",Jan 2020 •,"Last night in Rome , we wanted a special meal and certainly got one at ad hoc . We had the tasting menus with wine.  All great food, lovely fresh bread, we thoroughly enjoyed all of the courses and the service and ambience was very good. Lovely not to be rushed at all, great evening.  Highly recommend"

Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Birthday Dinner,Nov 2019 •,"We dropped in on a Saturday evening and got a table even though we had not reserved and it was very busy, We had the tasting menu which was delicious and wines excellent.  Service was very friendly and efficiant and overall a faboulus experience during our weekend in Rome at the end of November."
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Wonderful restaurant with great wine list,Jan 2020 •,"As Hoc is conveniently located not far from the Piazza del Popolo and Piazza di Spagna.  We had the Truffle set menu and the meat set menu, paired with wines. The sommelier was knowledgeable and explained what we were drinking.  The service was good but uneven, as at times the food arrived and then we had to wait for the wine.  The suckling pig and beef cheeks were rich and delicious.  The meal included an amuse bouche as well as three desserts and, finally, a gift of a small bottle of olive oil as we left.  A wonderful experience!"
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Tried to book this restaurant for New Year’s Eve,Jan 2020 •,"Tried to book this restaurant for New Year’s Eve unfortunately it was booked out which tells a story.    We had been having a relaxing day after New Year’s Eve celebrations we decided about 8pm to go for a walk and we stumbled across the restaurant by accident.  So we decided to go in how lucky we were we got the last table.  This restaurant is a well oiled machine they start you off with a small glass of wine and aperitifs lovely touch 
We both started with anti pasta dishes octopus pasta and cubed carbonara both were delicious and well presented 
For our mains we decided to go for suckling pig and fillet of beef we weren’t disappointed both dishes were delicious 
I’ve got to mention the lovely young lady sommelier who chose a lovely wine to compliment our meal.    We looked at the sweet menu and on another day we would have sampled something but we were both full l finished with a cappuccino and we were presented with a lovely mixture of small petit fours which was lovely 
There’s a cracking chef in this establishment with a great team round about him keep up the good work guys 10 out of 10 if your in Rome don’t leave without trying this restaurant a culinary experience"
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Fantastic experience!,Sept 2019 •,"The restaurant atmosphere was relaxing and beautiful. The food was amazing. I highly recommend the wine and truffle tasting menu. When it came time for dessert, we had a pre-dessert, dessert, and a post-dessert. They gave us a small bottle of olive oil to take with us. Later, they sent a thank you email with a cookbook attached. Fantastic experience!"
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Delicious food! Highly recommend!,Nov 2019 •,"We celebrated my 50th birthday here and it was a great choice!!!
The food is amazing, so delicious.  And portion sizes are big, so be warned!!! We really struggled to finish it, and that was after she recommended I just have a half size portion of the pasta!! My carbonara three ways was the best carbonara I’ve ever had!!!! Presentation is amazing, and lots of nice touches like the amuse-bouche and their own breads and petit fours.
The wine list is the best I’ve ever seen!! So much choice. 
Service is excellent, friendly and efficient. They made it a special night for me by bringing out a cake at the end and singing Happy Birthday to me!! 
When we’re back in Rome, we’ll definitely be eating here again!"
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Dinner,Dec 2019 •,"Ad Hoc,
Wonderful place.
The food is amazing.
A lot of option.. All is good and tasty.
Don't miss the ""taste dinner"" really unique and delicious."
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Atmospheric,Dec 2019 •,"Nice and cozy place just behind piazza del Popolo. Excellent service and really nice food with great selection of the first materials. 

The extra virgin olive oil made the difference and was surprisingly offered as a gift at the end of our meal. 
Totally recommend it for couples or special occasions.

The most important was the fact that there wasn’t a hurry to leave the table so as to replace you with other clients. They gave you time to decide and enjoy your meal. 

An atmospheric experience in the heart of Rome"
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Very Good,Dec 2019 •,"We always eat here every time we go to Rome. You really need a reservation. It isn’t as good as it use to be, but still one of our favorites"
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Birthday Treat,Dec 2019 •,"Went to Adhoc as a treat for my wifes surprise birthday trip to Rome. 
Upon arrival we received a very warm and friendly greeting from the staff. 
After a glass of fizz, we decided on a land taster menu with an amended desert and also a change to the wine (my wife doesnt enjoy red wine) and the black truffle taster menu with wine. 
The food was simply sublime every course a culinary treat for us both. 
Also received an amuse bouche and also a pre desert treat as well as petit fours!
The staff also Surprised my wife with a rendition of happy birthday as well much to her surprise. 
The staff couldn't have been better simply impeccable service and food. They couldn't do enough to help us, answer any of our questions or accommodate our requests. 
The venue is wonderful, very atmospheric and the perfect setting for a wonderful meal. 
We left with very full bellys and very satisfied by our experience. 
Would definitely come again."
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,4.5 to be fair,Dec 2019 •,"As you walk in you immediately notice hundreds of wine bottles around the walls, some fixed to the walls and some loose. At first it appears to be a cosy little restaurant but it's bigger than you think. Just after 8 it suddenly filled and not a single table remained empty. Not bad on a street which was full of nothing but restaurants. The general ambience was lovely,  buzzing conversation and nice lighting.  The staff were really friendly and even though busy, took the time to chat. Free glass of prosecco on arrival and a plate of petit fours at the end. The food itself was well cooked and presented.  I can highly recommend the cod starter. We shared a lobster spaghetti which was served up in 2 smaller portions and they allow you to have a couple of small portion mains like a tasting menu.  I had the beef fillet and the suckling pig. Both delicious. We marked down a bit because the Mrs had 2 dishes which were a bit dry and needed a sauce of some kind to make it more enjoyable.  Though we did put this on the feedback card they provided at the end. So a good 4.5 out of 5 and we would certainly recommend and return."

Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Dinner with my family,Oct 2019 •,"I read about Ad Hoc on the internet, since I was at Rome with my family on my birthday and I was trying to find a nice restaurant to go. We went there, but since I had no reservation, I couldn't do it. However, we really liked what we saw, so we booked a table for the day after and we are very glad we did it.
That was an emazing night. We were surprised by the great service and an even better food and wine experience. 
We spent 16 days travelling around Italy, mainly in Toscana, tasting all kind of italian dishes. However, the Ad Hoc night was our better food experience during the entire trip."
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Very good experience,Dec 2019 •,"Very good restaurant, good atmosphere, the menu is based on seasonal products and a lot of truffles and an impressive wine card"
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,So lucky to find this in Rome,Dec 2019 •,"One word “Excellent”. The tasting menu, which was white and black truffle based was astounding. The all women front of house knew their menus and wines.. what a selection. I hope that Thomas Keller, whom Chef Paul Bocuse on behalf-of French President Nicolas Sarkozy, presented to Keller as a Chevalier of The French Legion of Honor in 2011 in recognition of his lifelong commitment to the traditions of French cuisine and his role in elevating cooking in America; will open in London."
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Fantastic Birthday,Oct 2019 •,"For My wife's birthday in Rome I decided to make a reservation at Ad Hoc.  We are so glad we did. From the first greeting, the servers (who actually put a candle in my wife's dessert and sang Happy Birthday to her), to the cheerful good bye the service was 5 star.  We had two different tasting menus - both delicious.  The execution of each dish was perfect.  The wine pairings were spot on.  If you find yourself in Rome you should absolutely go to Ad Hoc for a great experience."
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Amazing Restaurant,Oct 2019 •,"We visit Rome every year and we were recommended this restaurant 3 years ago but unfortunately was always fully booked ! So we booked well in advance for our visit this year, we were not disappointed at all and can see why always busy.

Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,"A real ""Gem""",Dec 2019 •,"What a gorgeous venue. The room, ambiance, menu and wine list are exceptional. Make sure you book as it is more often than not booked out. The complimentary glass of prosecco and appetiser was a really treat also. If you love Truffles then you'll love this place. Our only complaint was that we were trying to enjoy the calm and unique ambiance and the staff were all talking amongst themselves around us and it was off putting."
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Amazing Culinary Experience!,Sept 2019 •,"We visited Rome for my husband’s birthday.

Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Wonderful meal,Oct 2019 •,This was our fifth visit to Rome and Ad Hoc and it never lets us down. Two of us had the tasting menu and two picked from the Al a Carte menu. Most restaurants don’t allow this but it was no problem to Ad Hoc. All the meals were superb. The staff are very friendly and knowledgeable. The wine list is amazing. Loved our visit.
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Charming Atmosphere and Superb Food,Sept 2019 •,"My fiancé and I went to Ad Hoc on the recommendation of a friend. We were given a call ahead of time, letting us know that the electricity was out but they would still be able to accommodate us. We arrived to a cavernous but cozy room aglow with candles. Our waiter was apologetic, but it was the most beautiful sight. The service was fantastic and the food was other worldly. We loved it so much. It was our favorite restaurant out of our week in Italy and we traveled to Rome and the Amalfi coast."

The dining room was quiet, relaxed and intimate. The perfect setting for an evening of great food and wine. We can't wait until we return to Rome and Ad Hoc."
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,ROMAN Tasting,Nov 2019 •,"We did a lot of research before choosing our hotel and restaurants for a three night Roman holiday.  Ad Hoc was out choice for the first night in Rome.  We walked to the restaurant from Babuino 181 hotel.  A short walk in a good area.

We arrived a bit early but they seated us immediately without a problem.  The restaurant is small, perhaps intimate is a better description but the table spacing and layout give each party ample privacy.  The decor is nice too.  It is essentially a wine cellar atmosphere with the restaurants wine selection surrounding the room on shelves with led lights.  

We ordered the Roman style cuisine tasting menu with the corresponding wine offer.  I though we would be selecting one item from each course but the menu includes everything.  We really enjoyed all of the food and all of the wine with one exception.  The dessert wine was not to our liking, but that was the only issue in an otherwise excellent meal.  

The service was excellent.  We would go back again and we have no issue to recommend the restaurant."
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Great tasting menu,Nov 2019 •,We went here fir the tasting menus and were not disappointed.  I had the Roman menu and my wife had the land menu all with wine pairings.  The meal starts with a welcome amuse bouche and sparkling wine.  There was also s pre and post dessert.

Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,All around amazing,Jul 2019 •,"We had our anniversary dinner at the Ad Hoc restaurant, and enjoyed the truffles tasting menu paired with wines.  The food was great, rivaling some of the best fine dining restaurants we've visited. Better yet, it was very reasonably priced at 125 euros per person including wine. The atmosphere is cozy and service personable and attentive. At the end of the dinner we we were presented with a special anniversary bottle of prosecco and an Ad Hoc labeled bottle of olive oil. 
The lovely experience continued after we returned home, with a mini restaurant e-cookbook arriving via email a few weeks after our visit. 
Highly recommend and definitely will return to this restaurant on our next visit to Rome."
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Six Stars if Possible,Nov 2019 •,"This is absolutely one of the best meals I've had in Rome.  From start to finish, each dish had wonderful flavor, and had unique style.  Service was exceptional, and presentation was as well.  The pumpkin blossoms and roulade in phyllo dough were great starters.  The special was a cake of veal and lamb that was simply outstanding, as was the sea bass and spaghetti.  They have a variety of truffles that can be added to any dish, which makes it a very unique experience.  The banana gelato was a perfect end to the meal as well!"
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Superb Ambience and tasting menu,Oct 2019 •,"We booked this in advance for my birthday meal.  Upon arrival we were shown to the nicest table in the house for 4 people which us slightly elevated surrounded on 3 sides by vintage bottles of red wine.  The lighting is perfect.

The truffle tasting menu paired with wines was perfect and I must say the portion sizes were generous!  I'm not an expert on truffles, but the food was of a high quality and well prepared.

After the meal we were presented with 2 bottles of Prosecco and some olive oil which was a nice touch.  The meal was good value as well for 4 people, recommneded. Perfecto!"

The food was spot on, the service and staff outstanding.

This establishement compares favorably to many 2 to 3 Michelin starred restaurants we have visited."
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Mysigt,Oct 2019 •,Very cozy restaurant with a great atmosphere! One of the waitresses were great and the rest of them OK. Food was good but I think we had even higher hopes! But it was absolutely worth the visit!

The place looks expensive and cosy at the same time, so you don’t feel uncomfortable. The service is great, the waiters know the menu perfectly and make good recommendations. The wine list is the best I’ve ever seen. More than 200 pages, I think, of high quality Italian wine. And the restaurant specialises in truffles. They have tasting menus and special truffle menu from which we ordered. Everything was amazing!"
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,A Pure Delight!,Oct 2019 •,A highlight of our 10 days in Rome.  Fine Dining at its best.  Terrific staff. Remarkable wine list is sure to please.
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Best Meal in Rome,Aug 2019 •,"My wife, daughter and I had a wonderful meal at Ad Hoc.  A friend recommended the resturant, and it certainly lived up to the recommendation.  When we went, the resturant had a special truffle menu — which we all ordered from.  It was simply delicious!  Even better — when we mentioned to the manager we were looking for a good resturant for cacio a pepe — it was not on the menu — she went to the kitchen and whipped up an order.  It was amazingly good.  Although we were stuffed, we topped it off with a special chocolate dessert.  As to wine, we let the sommelier pick for us and she did an outstanding job.  When in Rome .. eat at Ad Hoc!"
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Superb!,Oct 2019 •,"We liked everything about it: the food & wine, the understated elegance, the service. 
We indulged in some white truffles, currently in season. The sommelier was up to par, especially since Italian wines are not my strong suit. 
Reserve early, this restaurant is in high demand."
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Spectacular...,Aug 2019 •,"The treatment, dinner, wines, desserts, the atmosphere .... this restaurant is incredibly good.

First impression a place that know it’s wine,
Food and what customer experience should be ! A menu of good ckassics but well known for the truffle .... and what a tartar with mixed truffles supplied by recommended Pinot Noir from Haas ! Great mains and deserts served with a smile and small discussions - a memorable evening that will be repeated ! Thanks to the chef,
waiters at Ad Hoc 🍾🙏🏼"
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,WHAT A TREAT,Sept 2019 •,"My husband made our anniversary dinner reservations before we left the USA by reading past TripAdisor reviews.  This is a small, but wonderful restaurant.  A fresh rose was on our reserved table, and the food and wine were outstanding as was the top notch service. They called for a taxi when we were ready to leave because in Rome taxi's don't cruise like NYC.  A wonderful, memorable night."
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Simply Outstanding,Oct 2019 •,"I booked online as it was our anniversary, the food was fantastic along with the service. The staff had a wealth of knowledge about the food and wines, I will be going back.

To my surprise the bill should have been 170 Euro bu because I booked online, the gave me 10percent off. Paying 160 Euro for 7 course fine dining restaurant is very reasonable especially in Rome, I would highly recommended."
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Required when in Rome,Sept 2019 •,"We always go to Ad Hoc in Rome. The food is creative and delicious. The wine selection is fabulous! The staff is very attentive and have great knowledge of the wines.
We had a selection of appetizers which included a deconstructed zucchini flower.

Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,A little bit of quiet in Roma!,Jul 2019 •,"Fabulous meal, great service and a beautiful dining room - had an excellent meal at Ad Hoc on a hot night in July - we will be back!"
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Highly recommend this fantastic restaurant,Jul 2019 •,"I booked Ad Hoc after reading some positive reviews and some reviews referring to birthday meals. We were in Rome for a wedding but it coincided with my girlfriend's birthday so I was on the look out for a good restaurant for that night. Booking from the UK was easy and the communication was good, I was e-mailed asking if I want to pre-order a dessert as I had mentioned it was for my girlfriend's birthday. The day before the booking I received a call to confirm and when we arrived we were warmly welcomed and taken to our seat, which seemed to be the best table in the restaurant in my opinion, and we had a complimentary glass of sparkling wine each. Our host and all the waitresses were absolutely brilliant, so attentive and really knew the menu inside out. When each dish was brought out we were given detailed descriptions. We were given a complimentary starter which was delicious and we all ordered something different, so the sommelier helped us pair a good wine to the dishes. All the courses were incredible, for me the Pasta with truffles was brilliant, this was a starter on the night, and the Suckling pig was so nice. At the end of the meal the lights went out and the waitresses sang happy birthday to my girlfriend and brought out the tiramisu that I pre-ordered. After the dessert we got yet another complimentary dessert selection of home made biscuits and then just before we left a bottle of Ad Hoc's olive oil, which we had during our starter and loved, so this was a lovely touch. 

Overall unbelievably brilliant service, fantastic food and drink, can't recommend highly enough. If I go to Rome again I will defiantly be coming back"
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Try the truffle menu with wine pairings,Sept 2019 •,"Truly an experience to enjoy.  Right up there with the best restaurants in the world with one complaint.  The desserts were not up the the level of the rest of the meal at all.  However, don't let that put you off.  The rest of the meal was so outstanding that I could not mark them down for being disappointed in the dessert course. Go, enjoy and hope they improve dessert.  We come here every time we are in Rome."
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Our favorite,Sept 2019 •,Our second dinner in 4 years at Ad Hoc was simply fantastic. The service is top notch and the sommelier very knowledgeable and helpful. The food and the wine were the best we have had in Italy so far. We will return next time in Rome.

If you love truffles this is the place for you.

Every wonderful course we had was accompanied by delicious wine, so I can only thank the Ad Hoc team for a great dining experience."
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,What a special meal,Sept 2019 •,"Ate here for our wedding anniversary.  Had the truffle taster menu.  The food and the service was outstanding.  The staff are extremely hard working and everyone seems to help out so we didn’t have the same waitress the whole night but they were all equally pleasant and professional. 

The food was divine however even with such small tasters you start to feel quite full by the time the desserts arrive and it’s a really interesting way to try new things and enjoy different Italian wines.  Including a small appetiser there are 6 lovely courses to get through.  Bread served on the side is also varied and tasty but it can fill you up.

This is not somewhere you would eat regularly but it is wonderful for a special occasion."
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Fantastic,Sept 2019 •,"Went here for our anniversary dinner. The restaurant is well known for its tasting menus and its truffle flavoured dishes. The service was good and the food and wine, paired through the tasting menu, excellent. Expensive, but this is fine dining and well worth it."
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Excellent Experience,Sept 2019 •,I’ve read the negative reviews and our experience could not have been more pleasant. Albeit the tasting menu takes approximately 1-1.5 hours but that is part of the experience. The food and wine pairing were amazing and surprisingly we both left feeling more than satisfied in terms of the amount of food we ate. We found the staff to be pleasant and attentive and they provided numerous “free” treats and a small bottle of truffle oil when we left. Definitely worth the time and money.
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Fantastic,Sept 2019 •,"We visited Ad Hoc for a 50th Birthday celebration, the food and service were brilliant, staff very warm friendly and helpful, very memorable evening"

Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Amazing Resturant!,Sept 2019 •,"Right from the moment we entered, we were greeted by the kind and proffessional hostess, who showed us into a very classy and cosy dining room, where we were immediatly offered a welcome drink.
We both had the Roman Tasting Menu, and were blown away by how much taste they managed to incorporate into the relatively simple dishes! Not to mention all the extra little treats we were offered by the kitchen free of charge!
The only problem that I could possibly point out, is our shock, when we finished our dessert, full and quite content, and were presented with yet another plate of small treats!

If you are ever in Rome, you should definetly vist Ad Hoc for a food experience that will stay with you!"
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Fabulous Evening,Sept 2019 •,"From the moment we arrived we were looked after by all the staff.  We had  one of the tasting menus with wine flight and both the food and wines were fantastic.  Nothing was too much trouble and when my partner asked for a small ""top up"" he was brought another big glass. The atmosphere in the restaurant was lovely and we were given a gift at the en dof the evening - a little bottle of olive oil!  I cannot  recommend this restaurant highly enough!!!"
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Amazing,Sept 2019 •,"I can honestly say we had the best food you can ever have in Rome. My husband and I had dinner there and it was a night to remember. The food was amazing great wine and delicious sweets .

Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Amazing Restuarant,Sept 2019 •,"We tried to get into this restaurant which was fully booked. Tried for a second night and was able to get a 9:30 PM Reservation.  To summarize, this place is amazing.  I live in the San Francisco Bay Area and am spoiled by the fine cuisine of my city. First of all the ambience and service were amazing.  The food is cooked to perfection and presented very nicely.  The staff fare very service oriented and provide a genuinely friendly service.  To top it off, the prices are about half of what I would have paid in the Bay area. If you are in Rome, you can't miss this place."
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Just WOW!,Sept 2019 •,"I booked this restaurant as a surprise for my partners 60th Birthday and it certainly didn't disappoint.
I was very impressed that we didn't need to have the same taster menu - so many restaurants insist that you do.
However we both chose the 'land' menu. From start to finish the waitresses were so efficient and knowledgeable, clearly explaining each dish and  paired wine. There were also lovely extras thrown in too, such as a glass of fizz on arrival, an extra chef's special starter, homemade sweets after your dessert and a complimentary bottle of their own olive oil to take home. We also received a 10% discount for booking online. I would definitely visit here again on my next visit to Rome."
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Roman hospitality at its best.,Sept 2019 •,"Lovely staff make for a most enjoyable foodie experience;helpful and knowledgeable. Food good, not outstanding but well presented. Taster menu not UK style, but different dishes simultaneously on a plate with different sections. Works ok but not the luxury pace of taster menus I am familiar with. 
Excellent wine selection."

They gave us a delicious sparkling wine at the start, a complimentary taste from the chef and a lovely selection of sweets at the end. The service and staff were so nice and helpful.

Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,"Beautiful food, excellent service and all for a great price",Aug 2019 •,"We decided to treat ourselves to a nice meal in Rome as we were celebrating a birthday and so we chose Ad Hoc based on the reviews. 

This truly has to be one of the best meals we have ever had. On sitting down at your table you are provided with a free glass of sparkling wine and a complementary starter. Can’t fault a start like that. Next, all the dishes we ordered were fantastic. I ordered the pasta with octopus followed by the sea bass and both were delicious and the portions bigger than expected. The pasta was the best we had in Italy so I def recommend you give that a go. 

The service was incredible throughout but at no point rushed. The waitresses were lovely and very attentive (but not too much like in some restaurants). We even got a free dessert thrown in which was amazing. 

All in, eur 120 for a bottle of wine, two Pasta dishes and two mains inc service (plus all the freebies). Brilliant price for a wonderful experience."

One evening, while in Rome, we were thrilled to eat at Ad Hoc.  What a wonderful restaurant.  I should say here that I am gluten intolerant.  But, no worries here.  The staff went out of their way to make sure my dishes were perfect.  We were a large group of 9 and we were treated with the same care as a table of 2.  One of our group even entertained some of the staff with napkin folds and some magic tricks.  The wine list was extensive and we had the perfect guidance leading us to choose the perfect wines for our evening.  When we returned home the owner even sent us copies of some of his favorite recipes.  The experience was like dining at your very favorite restaurant in your very favorite city but this time in Rome.  Thank you so much."

We were content with our meals and passed on dessert however the restaurant treated us to an array of very satisfying and delicious sweets and a bottle of their olive oil to take home.  This was a special meal to remember.  Highly recommend this place."

Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Hidden Gem,Aug 2019 •,"We went to this restaurant after recommendation from our hotel, wonderful, friendly welcome into a cosy restaurant. So many wines displayed on wall. Staff couldn’t do enough for you. Lots of little extras, food was good but if I return to Rome and go there again wouldn’t have tasting menu as far too much food. Really good value for money and worth a visit but need to book."

Good work ,  keep it up"
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,FABULOUS,Aug 2019 •,"Everything all the five star reviews promised. Great space, fabulous attentive knowledgeable staff, well paced service, interesting menu and superb cooking. And at 250 euro for four, a good portion of which was for wine, we think good value. Happily adding this to our personal list of top global restaurants."
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Wonderful Meal,Jun 2019 •,"We ate here in late June while visiting Rome. Reservation for 4 at 20:00. Everything was wonderful - absolutely wonderful. The staff was beyond accommodating and made us feel as though we were the only ones in the restaurant. We all ordered the tasting menu (no pressure at all from the staff) - 3 with wine, 1 without. We were able to make substitutions between the tasting menus to satisfy our cuisine preferences. Portions were very fair - both food and wine. No skimping. Wine was well paired (and generously poured) and the food was simply delicious.  Can’t wait to go back!"
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Excellent atmosphere and food!,Jul 2019 •,"We are a family of foodies and this night we where celebrating the birthdays of our daughters. We decided to go to this well received restaurant. The service was warm and personal and they spent time to assist and discuss different wine pairings throughout the evening. Great! The choice of wines are very good and the walls are being used as wine storage. 
The aim of the restaurant was be perceived as a high end traditional Italian restaurant in a fine dining wrapping (complementary  dishes, service, attention to all details). They succeeded very well being developing a warm, personal atmosphere with fantastic dishes. The pasta was in our opinion the best we have had at a restaurant in our lives! If they want to be more fine dining there are details to be refined (smaller portions, more structured service and attention to details. ) Don't interpret me wrong. The place is fantastic and the service and atmosphere is what we want in Italy. The wines tasted was a Nebbiolo from Valtellina and a great Etna Rosso!. Well matched to the dishes.
Small notes to be refined- Given the quality of the wines they need to be chilled before served. Now they were served in the same temperature (approx 25 degrees). A few minutes in a wine cooler (also for the reds) are recommended.

Can highly recommend Ad Hoc"
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Best Restaurant for romantic dinner,Jul 2019 •,"Ad Hoc was excellent in terms of atmosphere, food, and service. Been there for dinner with wife and from the beginning, we felt really good and relaxed. The restaurant decor is really nice (bottle of wines on the shelfs and walls) and makes feel comfy and give you that feeling that you're in a nice restaurant   Staff was very helpful and informative, explain the menu in details and also they knew their food and wine. Food is really good but for my taste, the truffle dishes are a bit overpowered by truffle which is very fresh and intensive but that's only our opinion. Food presentation was really good, well-executed and really tasty. In the end, we pay 180 euros which I believe it was a fair price for the whole experience we also get two boxes of sweets and complementary Ad Hoc olive oil. That was a nice touch for our dinner. Generally well worth it to go why you in Rome especially for romantic dinner."
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Superb restaurant.,Jul 2019 •,"Good food. They have a lot of truffle dishes. Very good selection of wines. Friendly staff.

I picked out the best restaurants that I could find in each city, and booked them all in advance.  We all agreed that Ad Hoc was the best restaurant of the trip.  The staff were all very friendly from when we walked into the restaurant to when we said goodbye.  They made us feel welcome, and were happy to answer all of our questions.  The food was fabulous, from the appetizers to the dessert.  I had the sea bass which was exquisite, and the pasta was fresh, homemade and delicious.  They had an excellent variety of Italian wines at reasonable prices.  One of my colleagues is going to Rome in August, and Ad Hoc is the only restaurant that I recommended to her.  It's a must for any trip to Rome."

So glad they did.  Took a taxi to the spot.  They started us off with complimentary wine, bread, olive oil, balsamic. I think we ate 4 or 5 courses of food.  We had more wine and complimentary dessert as well.  They gave us a small bottle of their olive oil. Each course was delicious.  What's even better... It was only $40 US!

Staff is very friendly and tries to keep your happy all the time, although sometimes the service is a bit slow (it didn't ruin our experience at all - just be aware). The food is great. We were lucky to visit the place during annual truffles festival, so all dishes had an option to be lifted up with few slices of black truffle (yummy!!!). The basket with flavored breads selection was a nice touch. And the wine list (more like an endless scroll) served its purpose well. From the food I would recommend Carbonara al cubo and Guancia  Manzo Tartufo."

Every detail was attended to, we had our own space in the back of the restaurant, and our server felt like she'd known us for years.

Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Anniversary Celebration,Jun 2019 •,"I took my wife to this restaurant while visiting Rome in early June.
It is a very busy restaurant but they were able to fit us in for a 9 30pm sitting. We opted for the taster menu with wine selection to accompany the food. Well the food was absolutely amazing! I lost count of the amount of food brought to our table over 5 or 6 courses. We thought the wine might be small but we were wrong. The wines brougt to us were in quite sizable glasses so a very good quantity was served. And each piece of food or wine brought to us was described in terms of where it came from by the knowledgeable and enthusiastic staff. If you like good quality food at a reasonable price I would strongly recommend this restaurant as one to put on your visit list."

Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Truffle Madness!,May 2019 •,"SO overdue for this review, I and my husband went last year for our honeymoon vacation in Italy. My esthetician suggested Ad Hoc and I'm super glad we went because they have a separate menu just of truffles! Book in advance online, it was very easy to do so. And upon arrival our waitress greeted us with some prosecco, super nice of her to do so. We tried the prix fix menu, of course  from the truffle menu. Everything was delicious and we were open to try everything. Each dish came with wine pairing, and portions were good. The staff is very sweet and talked about every dish we received. At the end of our meal the waitress gifted me their olive oil, and I have to say we left full and extremely happy. I would definitely go back when in Rome. :) The experience was memorable."

Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,You won’t find finer dining in Rome!,May 2019 •,"Dear Massimiliano, 

Firstly I would like to thank you, and your staff for an excellent night at your restaurant. As you know it was for my 50th birthday, and so it was a very special evening. From the moment we walked in “Roma” greeted us with smiles and showed us to our table. 

Nothing was too much trouble, and Roma explained how the menu worked, and if we wanted, we could change 1 or 2 of the dishes. The food was excellent, and everyone in our group said it was the best dining experience they had ever had! The wines were excellent too, and again, we could change them if needed. “Roma” explained in great detail about every food dish and the accompanying wine served with them. Which vineyard they came from and the grape used. 

We were initially going to go to Harry’s Bar, as I have visited there many times before when in Rome. May I say your food, wine and service exceeded any of these visits, and when we return to Rome, we will definitely be booking with you. 

Thank you so much, and please thank “Roma” and the chef for making a special evening, unforgettable."
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Outstanding Dining Experience,Apr 2019 •,"Our evening at Ad Hoc proved to be fantastic in every way.  We had made reservations well in advance (a must) and we were seated in a beautiful dining room surrounded with shelves of wine bottles, beautifully lit.  We were immediately treated to complimentary glasses of prosecco while we viewed the menu.  I had the truffle tasting menu with wine pairings, and I highly recommend it.  It started with pumpkin blossoms with ricotta and truffles.  For primo, tonnarelli pasta with butter, parmesan and truffles.  For the main course I chose the braised beef cheeks with truffles.  This was followed by a selection of desserts.  The wine pairings were just right, and I was particularly pleased with the Amarone served with the beef.  Throughout, the service was attentive and cordial.  As a parting gift, we received a bottle of their own branded olive oil- an excellent reminder of a dining experience in Rome to be remembered."
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Returned and not disappointed,May 2019 •,"If you like food then this is simply a must visit. The whole dining experience is amazing. Our second visit and we were prepared to eat well. I chose the tasting menu [land] with wine pairing and it was excellent. My wife had learnt from her previous experience and opted for something less substantial. 
Highlights in a meal of high quality were my wife's pasta/ragout with truffles and pretty much all of my selection. The wines matched beautifully and the waitresses were so knowledgeable and articulate. 

Truly amazing. Number 1 on my list of things to do should we visit Rome for a third time."
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Fantastic choice for a special evening,Feb 2019 •,"After checking other reviews, I have chosen this restaurant to propose to my girlfriend on a lovely February evening in Rome.

Highly recommended to anyone visiting Rome!"
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Graham,May 2019 •,"Wow. What a restaurant. What can I say. From start to finish this was one of my best  dining experiences ever. The staff were so welcoming, very friendly and knew their food and wine (which is very important in Italy). The food was incredible and the montepuociano I had was one of the best Iv ever tasted. The little touch of a free gift of their own olive oil when we left just summed up the quality and detail of the place. Couldn’t recommend highly enough."
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Fabulous!,May 2019 •,"Everything about Ad Hoc works. From the warm welcome to the lovely room which is decorated with a vast array of wine bottles. Service and quality always seem to be the key focus of the staff, we were seated and quickly given a complimentary and welcoming glass of prosecco while we made our choices from the menu. As with previous evenings we tried a variety of starters before moving onto the pasta/main courses. We also ordered some white wine by the glass and an excellent value Cabernet Sauvignon from the Hofstatter estate in the Alto Aldige.

The food was excellent, great flavor and top-quality ingredients. The Tonnarelli with butter, parmesan and truffle was especially memorable."
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Absolutely incredible meal!,May 2019 •,This was our favourite meal of Rome.

Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Excellent dinner in a romantic setting,May 2019 •,"I did one of the tasting menus and loved everything on it.

Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Glad we booked,May 2019 •,"I had read on Trip Advisor about this restaurant and booked before we flew to Rome.  The only reservation I could get was at 9.30 on our last evening and I am so glad that we decided to go for it.  It is in a quiet (at night) side street between the Via del Corso and the river and the first thing we noticed on entering was the delicious smell of truffle.  It took us a very long time to choose what to eat as there was such a choice but in the end we went for one of the tasting menus with matching wines and every single bit of food on our plates was delicious, especially the truffled pasta.  The recommended wines were all red but they changed these to rose/white to suit our taste and were wonderful. All the waiting staff were female and were first rate.  I can't recommend this restaurant highly enough."
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,"Great food, wonderful service",May 2019 •,"The service at Ad Hoc is wonderful, the wine list is the most impressive I have ever seen in my life. We had the roman and land tasting menu's - most of the food was wonderful, there were a few things that were just okay for me. Come very hungry because there is A LOT of food, and the portions are large. All in all, it's worth a trip - I can highly recommend the carbonara three ways, the suckling pig, the beef pasta/pea&asparagus ravioli course and the dessert."
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Wonderful Dinner at Ad Hoc ..,May 2019 •,"We visited Ad Hoc whilst on a long weekend to Rome, we had booked before leaving London.

Whilst we waited we savoured the warmth of the restaurant, the aroma of truffles & listened to the happy buzz of of diners having a great time. We were shown to our table after a few mins & served a complimentary glass of Italian Sparkling Wine to drink whilst we looked at the menus.  Everything on the menu sounded  absolutely delicious, we could have ordered everything! In the end of long deliberations we both decided on a taster menu, there was a choice of 4, so we could sample a little of many dishes! We made an excellent choice, everything we tasted we loved & the dishes were presented beautifully.  Truffle Pasta 10/10! Suckling Pork 10/10 Dessert of Italian Vanilla Creme & sponge 10/10 scrummy! You can also have wine to accompany each course of the taster menus, we chose white wine & were served a selection of excellent Italian wines & dessert wine.  The food & wine were all 10/10, but very best of all about Ad Hoc are the staff. They create a calm, happy, friendly, relaxed & attentive atmosphere. They were also very  knowledgeable about their menu & extensive Italian wine selection. It was a thoroughly enjoyable experience. Nothing was too much of an effort for them, it felt like dining with great friends. I hope I get to return again one day. Book Ad Hoc, you won’t regret it."

We had the truffle dining experience which involved several courses surrounding featuring truffles. By the end we had 12 courses as the added extras just kept coming. The food was delicious and definitely meant we tried stuff we wouldn’t normally have, although by the end it’s safe to say I couldn’t eat it all. We had the added wine tasting experience which included good quality wines from local regions at a very reasonable price so would highly recommend adding this.

Its a fantastic warm place with wine boxes lining the walls and candles on the tables.  It's in a fantastic part of town only a fifteen-minute walk from the Trevi Fountain. 
My fiancee is a huge foodie and we eat at some of the best restaurants in the world. The food at Ad Hoc is at a really affordable price point, and for the dining experience we had, we were surprised it didn't cost more. We had the tasting menu with matching wines and were blown away. 
We are back in Rome at the moment and couldn't get a table, and we understand why. 
It's wonderful. ...go!

Everything from the glass of Prosecco to start, enters, starters, mains and desserts was excellent.

All 8 of us agreed that this what the best meal we had during our time in Rome and have been talking about the experience ever since. This is the type of restaurant where you let the waiter or waitress tell you what to order and sit back and enjoy the experience.  I would not hesitate to recommend this restaurant to anybody visiting Rome and we will certainly be back again on our next trip to Italy.

Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Perfect dining experience at Ad Hoc Restaurant.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!,Mar 2019 •,"My wife and I celebrated our 20 year Anniversary at Ad Hoc Restaurant on March 26.  We could not have chosen a better restaurant!  Our menu choice that evening was the 'Seafood Tasting' that included wine.

We arrived at 7:00pm and left at 11:30pm.  Yes, we were there 4 1/2 hours, and loved every minute of it!  From your gracious hostess the moment we walked in, perfect service, incredible courses, and perfectly matched wines, our dinner far exceeded our hopes and expectations.  We were offered a complimentary glass of Prosecco as we arrived, and even offered a very thoughtful 'thank you' gift for visiting as we departed.

20 years ago my wife and I honeymooned in France, France at a restaurant that FODOR's at the time rated the #1 restaurant in the world.  We spent 4 hours for dinner their that evening.  We rate our dinner experience at Ad Hoc Restaurant every bit as memorable and enjoyable as our dinner in France.

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND to anyone visiting Rome to make sure that you dine at AD HOC Restaurant.  It is reasonably priced, food is over the top outstanding as well as the service."

Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Fantastic!,Apr 2019 •,"We had an outstanding  meal here.  Upon being seated, the hostess brought us complimentary glasses of Prosecco, which was a very nice gesture.  My daughter and I shared the pumpkin blossoms, stuffed with ricotta cheese and asparagus.  Lightly battered and fried, they were delicious!  My husband had Vermicelli with octopus-
With garlic, oil, chilli pepper, cherry tomatoes and pecorino di fossa cheese, while my son-in law had the stuffed cannelloni.  For main courses, my daughter had the lamb special, my son-in-law had the Tuscany beef fillet erved with buttered spinach and roasted potatoes, and I had the vermicelli with octopus.  We were so stuffed, we did not order dessert, but we were brought a tower of Italian cookies, and other delights.  This meal was fabulous!  The owner brought the women a small bottle of virgin olive oil, and the men got the bill!!!!"

Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,In expected surprise,Mar 2019 •,"We were looking for a place for dinner one night in Rome and happened upon Ad Hoc. 
Very pleasant surprise. Food was outstanding, the wine selection was excellent, the truffles divine and the service was very friendly. 
We truly enjoyed our meal."
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,"Fabulous food, atmosphere and staff",Apr 2019 •,"I made a reservation at Ad Hoc for our first evening in Rome, the food was excellent as was the service and atmosphere. We enjoyed it so much we made a reservation for our final night and again everything was excellent. On our first visit we chose from the a la carte menu for our second visit we chose the ‘Land’ tasting menu, both were delicious and would highly recommend Ad Hoc to anyone visiting Rome. 
Thank you for two fabulous evenings."
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,A perfect evening,Apr 2019 •,"After doing a great deal of research before booking this restaurant I was delighted to find that it more than exceeded our expectations.
The warm welcome we received allowed us to relax from the moment we entered this beautiful restaurant. The ambiance enhances the experience with thoughtful lighting, enough table space and a little background music.
Further welcomed with glass of dry Prosecco we settled at our more than comfortable table.
My wife chose the Roman tasting menu whilst I selected the Land tasting menu both with wine pairings.
 At 85 euros each (10% discount if you book online) it proved to be great value for money.
Highlights from an extensive offerings were the ravioli filled with cheese with asparagus and cream.
Beef tartar, carbonara with truffle and the desert of soft Roman cake with cherry.
Amazing food complimented with an array of rich tasting wines.
Please visit you will not be disappointed."
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,exilent,Mar 2019 •,Delicious food and wine. Recomended if your in Rome. Best meal we've had during our visit. Meet up hungry
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Excellent!!,Mar 2019 •,The food here is amazing! Yes it's a little pricey but as it's fine dining it's worth it. And you get a lot of food for your money unlike some fine dining places. There's a few tasting menu options (one dedicated to truffles!) Or you can order each course from the normal menu. Servers were all really friendly and can help choose the wine (there is a huge book to choice from!) And there's a few little nice surprises as well just to top off the experience. Would recommend to go when you've plenty time to enjoy each course and the atmosphere.
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Unbelievable food - fantastic service!,Feb 2019 •,"Ad Hoc was an amazing experience from start to finish - I booked this reservation a few weeks ahead of a family trip to Rome after reading some mommy blog that said it was kid friendly (I would say 12+) wine bar. I e-mailed the restaurant to alert them to an allergy that my step sons have and when we arrived, everyone was aware of the allergy and they extremely accommodating with the menu and the service was great throughout dinner. Now, on to the food - unbelievable! I knew I loved truffle, but this was beyond my expectations - truffle EVERYTHING, you can literally have everything on the menu with truffle. I loved the truffle so much that I even tried to make another reservation for a free night we had a few days later, but unfortunately they were fully booked. I can't say enough great things, the staff was great, the restaurant itself was beautiful, the wine selection was excellent and the food was amazing!"
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Superb cuisine featuring truffles every night,Mar 2019 •,"What a find! This restaurant vastly exceeded our expectations.  Superb food, friendly and helpful staff, and a massive wine list.  Sommelier was terrific in helping us make a great, reasonably priced selection."
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Absolutely fantastic!!,Mar 2019 •,"I booked this restaurant as part of my girlfriends 30th birthday several months before heading to Rome based on a lot of the reviews below, and I am so happy that I did! 

Upon arrival we were greeted by a lovely waitress who showed us to our table and took our jackets. A few minutes later two glasses of prosecco arrived at the table which was a lovely touch. There is an extensive wine list by the glass or bottle and we opted for a glass of wine each (then another 2 more after our mains)

There are several options for dinner, such as the tasting menus, with or without paired wines as well as a tasting menu with  or without truffles for those who fancy something slightly different. 

We went for the Ad Hoc tasting of starters - beef tartare, roulade with prosciutto and buffalo cheese, and pumpkin blossom with ricotta and basil and they were all very tasty! 

We opted for a selection of mains (where you can try two different mains but as a smaller portion) I went for Seabass rolled in zucchini and beef cheek, and my girlfriend went for suckling pig and breaded cod fish. We were very happy with our choices as they were so very tasty and the portion size was just right. 

Upon requesting the bill, the waitress said she would be a few minutes. Upon her return she cam back with a chocolate and cream dessert with a candle in it singing happy birthday  - much to the embarrassment of my girlfriend! It was a lovely touch by the waitress/restaurant. 

I cannot fault this place at all - superb wine list, incredible food and fantastic hospitality! I would definitely recommend making a reservation and nex time I am back in Rome will definitely be heading back"
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Tour of the Coliseum and Vatican,Feb 2019 •,My wife and I dined at Ad Hoc in Feb.  We are from Northern California and have dined at several of the Michelin starred restaurants in Napa Valley. Our experience at Ad Hoc with both service and food rivaled any of the restaurants we have dined at in Napa Valley. I highly recommend Ad Hoc.
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Best restaurant in Rome,Dec 2018 •,"My girlfriend and I have been in Rome at several occasions and this restaurant is by far the best we have been at. Great atmosphere, tasty menus and outstanding service."
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,The best meal I had in my 12 days Italy trip!,Feb 2019 •,I still remember the scents of truffles when the first dish arrived! The truffle set with wine pairing is highly recommended as the truffles are so fresh and match with the dishes! Personnally I prefer the carbonara most! The pasta is well cooked with cheese and the truffles still stand out! The wine pairing is good too and served by knowledgeable staff. The price is fair considering the food quality and the overall dining experience. I'd love to come back if there is a chance :)
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,A bilingual beauty,Feb 2019 •,We had a fantastic evening in Ad Hoc when we last visited Rome at the end of February.  The waitress even indulged my pathetic attempts at Italian and gave me both menus so i could cheat if needed!  The food is really lovely here - very imaginatively presented.  We didn't go with the tasting menu but chose from the a la carte which had something for everyone. The complimentary prosecco on arrival was a lovely touch and we got some great tips for our wine selection.  The service was extremely professional but warm at the same time. The bill was very reasonable for the quality and overall experience.  The gift of a bottle of olive oil when we left was a big but very welcome surprise.  You should try this restaurant!
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Definitely high end,Mar 2019 •,"I'm sure they are aiming for a Michelin star. But they still have a way to go. Nice staff even when they are busy. Had a tasting menu with wine included which gave us starters, a selection of pastas. Excellent. Pork and fish for mail course. Interesting and nicely presented. Absolutely worth trying if you want something else than the pizza/pasta places. Fair price too  EUR 85."
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,One of the best in Rome!,Mar 2019 •,"Wow - superb restaurant!

Truffle dishes are a must, we didn’t opt for a tasting menu and instead we tried a few pasta dishes and highly recommend them. 

Service was fantastic, very knowledgable with explaining the truffles and wider menu.

It was a celebratory dinner for birthday and they very kindly brought dessert with a candle which was a lovely surprise!

Great ambience - see the photos. 
A gem of a restaurant and I highly recommend it!"
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,"Great food, fun and attentive staff - Great experience!",Aug 2018 •,My partner and I read about Ad Hoc and decided to try it.

Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,If I could give 6 stars I would!,Mar 2019 •,We tried 2 of the tasting menus with wine. All of the food was excellent and we were absolutely full at the end. The wine pairings suited perfectly and the whole tasting menu was well priced. It was our 10th wedding anniversary and all of the staff made a special effort - a truly memorable evening. If you are visiting Rome this is definitely a place to add to your itinerary.  Thanks to all of the staff - you have left us with a lovely memory.
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Fantastic,Mar 2019 •,"Loved the truffle options. have eaten here twice in the past year and we loved each meal.

Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,A wonderful evening,Mar 2019 •,"We visited here on a trip to Rome, celebrating a seventieth birthday. After researching various restaurants I found Ad Hoc and there was something about the name that caught my attention. What a joy!
We were warmly welcomed, given time to enjoy a complimentary glass of fizz before being offered the menu which was explained in such a professional yet friendly manner. No rush whatsoever. Then the wine menu...sheer delight. The sommelier arrived to help with an ultimate decision, then the food arrived. Sheer bliss....you have to experience the delicate flavours, wonderful presentation and timely intervals for yourself.
Finally, delightful little delicacies to compliment what had been a truly excellent meal.
Well done Ad Hoc....you are wonderful!"
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Superb,Feb 2019 •,"Visited this restaurant during a weekend trip to Rome. From the moment we booked via email to the night of our meal the customer service was superb. One of our party was celiac and this was not an issue for the restaurant in fact they went out if their way to help. Service first class and the menu and food quality was amazing.so good in fact that we tried to get a reservation for the following night but it was fully booked . I had the fish based tasting menu which was stunning. 
This is one of the best restaurants I have eaten in anywhere in the world"

Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Fantastic experience at all levels!,Mar 2019 •,"I cannot be more pleased to have visited this restaurant. It was our last day in Rome to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday and exceeded all the expectations.

Everything was just perfect from the moment we walked in, very friendly, professional and knowledgeable staff, beautiful and cosy interior. We had a lovely table by the window, it's a small space but somehow everything is laid out so that you still retain your privacy.

And the food was top class, we had 2 different tasting menus with wines. The portions were generous and had variety of different tastes within one plate. Food and Wines were served at the same time, no waiting or missing orders. Again top marks.

Their attention to detail is amazing, I booked the Birthday dinner about month and a half before as a surprise and to top it all off, they brought dessert in with a little candle singing happy birthday! I didn't think they would remember.

All in all I cannot rate it high enough. Highly recommended, good value for money and you leave the place with a smile on a face! Will visit again when back in Rome."
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Amazing experience! Food...wow!,Mar 2019 •,We are so glad we visited here on our last night in Rome. The staff were lovely and the food...just amazing! Highly recommend!

Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Excellent choice fo rdinner,Mar 2019 •,"Busy restaurant so best to reserve a table for dinner.  Very friendly and helpful staff with good English.  A relaxed atmosphere, welcoming glass of Prosecco provided.  A wide range of wines by the glass available.  Nice choices on the menu, dishes cooked and presented really well with attention to detail and high quality ingredients. Truffles are a speciality of the restaurant.  The most enjoyable dinner we had during our stay in Rome, highly recommended."
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Lovely Evening,Feb 2019 •,"We had our best meal whilst in Rome at this restaurant. The interior is beautiful - like being inside a wine cellar, with an extensive wine menu to match! The staff were very friendly and extremely knowledgeable. The food was lovely, and with it being my birthday, they put a candle in dessert and sang happy birthday, which was a nice touch. All in all, beautiful restaurant with great food and friendly staff - a must visit whilst in Rome, particularly if it's a special occasion!"
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Still fantastic!,Mar 2019 •,"We visited Ad Hoc restaurant four years ago with friends and had a really fantastic meal and a very enjoyable night. We had said that if we ever got the chance to return to Rome we would also return to Ad Hoc.
This time we had the taster menu with wines. What a fabulous meal we had. Each course was full,of flavour and the wines were really great. The only criticism of our meal is that the portions were quite large and by desert we were overly full. Not really a complaint!
If you are in Rome and want a really fantastic dinner, and are prepared to spend a little above the average, then book a table at Ad Hoc. You will be glad you did!"
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Excellent as always great meal,Feb 2019 •,Wonderful evening out - service immaculate and food excellent- good choice of wines. Very good value for a restaurant of this class.

We will be back next time in Rome, - be sure!"
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Superb 20th Anniversary Dinner,Jan 2019 •,"Went with the family to Rome to celebrate our 20th anniversary ( was a surprise for my wife) and I chose this restaurant for our celebratory dinner.

We had a great table at the back of the restaurant and the decor is very different to the UK, wine bottles everywhere and this made this a really nice change.

The food was really good, especially the trio of beef tartar which my 15 year old daughter loved....main courses had a good choice and portions are and acceptable size. Further I arranged in advance for a special dessert (no dairy as wife is lactose intolerant) and this was prepared and was lovely.

The service was great attentive but not obtrusive.

Overall an excellent experience, I can recommend this restaurant however it gets busy so an advance reservation will probably be required.

Lastly the owner sent us an electronic cook book to remember our experience and this was a really nice touch."
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Excellent experience,Jan 2019 •,"I had dinner on a Saturday evening, and was delighted by the welcoming service, the nice atmosphere/decor and the quality of the menu and wines. I particularly enjoy truffled dishes, so this was a great choice. Being in Rome for a weekend I was afraid of choosing a 'tourist trap' type of restaurant. Ad Hoc treats you very well from beginning to the end, and I left with a great feeling after an enjoyable Italian dining experience. Honestly, I would love to come back on my next trip to Rome. Work well done by the managers and team."
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Highlight of the holiday,Feb 2019 •,This is by far one of the best restaurants in Rome. Staff were friendly and attentive and the food was perfect in every way.

Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Fantastic birthday meal!,Feb 2019 •,"Came here with friends to celebrate my wifes birthday and wow....we had a fantastic time there. A lovely table at the top surrounded by wine! Food and service was superb. Little complimentary nibbles came out, and at the end the staff singing Happy Birthday to my wife with a beautiful birthday dessert which further added to our wonderful experience. Egma, our waitress was wonderful, she was very friendly and helpful especially when helping to choose some bubbles and at the end on leaving the ladies in our party where present with a little gift. Overall, a wonderful place!"
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Absolutely fabulous,Feb 2019 •,What a stunning find in the centre of Rome.

Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,The best meal we had in Rome.,Feb 2019 •,"This place is legit.  Its a traditional Italian meal, so expect to be there for three luxurious hours.  The food and wine kept coming and coming. There were truffles galore! I don't know what it is called in Italian, but they gave us a pre dessert, then dessert, then some kind of after dessert.  You will not be disappointed if you go here, but make sure you make reservations in advance."
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Perfect dinner,Jan 2019 •,"Great dinner, the truffle menu is a must, but the rest is also excellent, We had the burrata with black truffle and some great pasta. We loved it and will go back as soon as we get to Rome again."

Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Unbelievable experience,Dec 2018 •,"Amazing experience in Rome.
Lovely restaurant in the heart of the city. 
Cool dishes and superb truffles.
I have been with my family and a couple of friends and we paid around 73€ per couple.
Super.
We will be back for sure"
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,our best food experience in Roma - truffles delight,Jan 2019 •,"From service to decor Everything was perfect we could taste various masterpiece of the menu with truffles, delicious and generous. For 70€ for two we had an amazing diner remarkable quality for price. we had lovely bottle of olive oil as a gift at the end. A must go!"
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Ad Hoc,Oct 2018 •,"Everything was perfect. The warm welcome when we arrived . The restaurant was cozy and we felt very comfortable. I liked the concept of the restaurant in which you find walls of bottles of wines . The food was very delicious and tasty. The staff was very friendly .
At the end we had gifts for everyone : small bottles of house Olive Oil.
We really appreciate the good service of Adhoc and we had an amazing dinner time."
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,The perfect celebration,Jan 2019 •,"I had searched through many restaurants for my husband's perfect birthday dinner.  When we arrived in Rome our concierge said that we should enjoy Ad Hoc but it wasn't necessarily a celebration venue.  I completely disagree!  The small, intimate restaurant designed its seating so that there is more privacy in certain sections than at many Roman restaurants.  The wine bottles lining the room make one feel like you have been invited to dine in a family's private cellar.  For fans of truffles, that is their speciality, and they do no it well.  The carbonara cubo was so good that my husband stole it and left me with his pasta course, which fortunately for me, was also excellent.  The lamb dish on special was exquisite, but the beef cheeks were also a magnificent choice.  My husband was also touched that the chef did also gift him with a special dessert in honour of his birthday.  The restaurant is on a quiet street and is completely walkable from several fine hotels, and it was open on a Sunday."
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,A Dining Highlight,Jan 2019 •,"This was a wonderful dining experience. Upon arrival, we were shown to a private booth for our family of four and offered a complimentary glass of prosecco.  While the multi-course meal was delicious, what we appreciated most was how the staff bent over backward to accommodate our daughter, who is vegan. It's not easy finding vegan meals in Rome (aside from the ubiquitous past in red sauce), but here the chef offered numerous options for her and she loved them all (and the rest of us loved our cheese and meat courses). To top off this very satisfying meal, we were each offered a small bottle of olive oil as a parting gift.  Prices were very reasonable as well. It was a memorable experience and we will be sure to visit Ad Hoc on future trips to Rome."
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Amazing Dinner,Jan 2019 •,"We decided to go with the taster menu and absolutely loved it. The waiters were proffessional, the sommelier made our night and the food was perfect. we will definitely go back again. If you want an amazing meal in an intimate atmosphere, then AD HOC is the place to go."
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Wonderful food and a warm welcome,Feb 2019 •,"A gastronomic delight and the staff worked well with our party of 14 who were in Rome for the rugby and catching up with each other for the first time in a while.  We were fairly loud for such a sophisticated restaurant but the staff were accommodating.  Most of the party had one of the tasting menus and the food was extremely tasty, the helpings defeated some of the party and the wine choices complimented each course.  I hope we get the chance to return in a couple of years but maybe I should ask for a private room."
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,50th birthday dinner oh so worth it,Jan 2019 •,"Dined here in January for my 50th birthday. The service is wonderful, made to feel very special. Excellent use of truffles, food is fresh and portion sizes are very generous. Highly recommended. In fact the food in Rome is sublime.. and extremely reasonable"
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,A cozy but classy treat! Wine-lovers' heaven!,Jan 2019 •,"We had dinner at Ad Hoc on New Years Day 2019. After a warm welcome (and a cool bubbly welcome drink) we were told that in this restaurant there is no RUSH. Even though the restaurant was almost full, we experienced a sense of tranquility and waiters were not 'pushing' you to order or to clear a table. To call the wine list 'extensive' is an understatement: it's (Trump-voice) HUGE! The staff have excellent knowledge of wine, grappa etc. At midnight was the birthday of my partner and the Ad Hoc team made it a special moment in a classy way! The spaces are cozy, wine bottles are wall-to-ceiling and the decor is simple yet elegant but COZY. The food was good but what really makes Ad Hoc stand out is the EXPERIENCE. From start to finish: a treat. Highly recommended."
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Amazing dinner,Nov 2018 •,"My wife and I visited ""Ad hoc"" in November 2018 and had a great time during our dinner there! The enviroment was unique, the staff was really polite and helpful and, of course, the food was fantastic, just like the wine! One of our best moments in Rome, and a place that we would love to visit again!"
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Amazing End to Our Italian Honeymoon,Nov 2018 •,"My wife and I took a 2 week honeymoon to Italy that started the day after we got married. We enjoyed meals in Como, Venice, Florence and Rome with our very last meal being at Ad Hoc. WHAT AN EXPERIENCE IT WAS! We were greeted by incredibly friendly staff and the rest of the dining experience was as wonderful as two honeymooners could ever ask for. We were sat at a window-side table where we could watch people passing by and admiring the beauty of the decor inside the restaurant. It made us feel very fancy! We were pleasantly assisted in selecting one of the best wines we had during our entire honeymoon trip. Then we proceeded to enjoy one of the best meals of the trip as well! Not only was the food extremely delicious but the ambiance, the welcoming staff and the surprise ""Happy Honeymoon!"" dessert plate at the end really made it nothing short of a special and memorable meal. I could not have been more pleased in the fact that I decided on Ad Hoc for our last meal in Italy - it only left us that much more excited to return some day. Thank you to everyone who played a role in our experience here - it was delightful!"

Far from your typical “tourist like” Pasta/Pizza Restaurant Ad Hoc was a culinary experience and from the moment we arrived you could tell they understood quality and making the customer feel welcome. It was anight to remember and finished with the lovely small touch of a gift of Petit deserts and a small bottle of Extra Virgin olive oil to take home.
As a Coeliac they were more than accommodating with Gluten Free options.
Such a great restataurant and experience that I would highly recommend for anyone wanting a great evening. Keep up the great work."
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,A wonderful dinner in a very cool looking restaurant.,Dec 2018 •,"My daughter and I both had a wonderful dinner.  

The restaurant itself was very cute and fun looking.  The service attentive, but not pushy.  We did the one of the tasting menus and found that each course was well prepared.  The menu had a nice selection of both tasting and à la carte.  If you enjoy truffles, there were many dishes that featured them.

The price point was actually a very good deal for the quality of the food.

All and all a very cool place.  I will come back next time I am Rome."

Our best dining experience in Rome,Dec 2018 •,"My family and I went to Ad Hoc restaurant on Christmas Day, during our visit to Rome and had a superb experience, starting with the 201-page red wine menu , the truffle-themed dishes and the excellent service and recommendations. I should add that as a gluten-intolerant person, I had no problem having the dishes I wanted adapted. I can highly recommend the zucchini flowers, the pasta with black truffle and the Casanova Brunello di Montalcino wine. We also got small bottles of olive oil as a good-bye gift and an electronic cookbook with some of their tasty Italian recipes. Can't wait to go back!"

We were welcomed by the door and the restaurant decor was also very welcoming, we were shown our table on the side as requested and we were given the menus. We have opted for the black truffle tasting menu and they have accomodated me with my dietary requirements. The food was exquisite from beginning to end and the service was impeccible.

Friendly , attentive staff , our waitress was very knowledgable about the food and the extensive wine selection and we were happy to follow her recommendations . All three courses were gorgeous and there was lovely little complimentary treats in between . At the end of the night I was given a little bag with a small bottle of olive oil to take home which was a nice touch . It was a wonderful, relaxed night in a cosy warm restaurant and I would recommend it to anyone . The only thing we both would have changed is that our table for two was tucked behind a wall. There was a table for six the in the ‘corridor ‘ area too and until that was filled we felt cut off from the rest of the restaurant"

The food was fantastic, we went for the tasting menu with the wine and all dishes were a reasonable size and we left feeling stuffed. Nice touches included the extra small dishes in between courses, mineral water, a glass of sparkling wine on arrival and a birthday message and candle for my wife. The witress also deserves a special mention for really good knowledge of all the food and wine and explanation of each when brought to the table (in english). Very pleasant restaurant environment with lovely ambience and perfect for a special occasion. Book online (very easy to do) for a discount, price reflects quality of restaurant. Highly recommend."
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,"Adhoc Restaurante, Rome",Dec 2018 •,"We went for dinner and I must say that we had a very pleasant evening. The staff were super, explaining the different dishes. The wine list, rather the wine ""book"" was a bit daunting. We just asked the waitress to advise us and her choice was excellent. At end of evening, guests were given a small bottle of olive oil, nice detail. The bill was fair considering the high quality of the restaurant. I would definitely recommend it. Best to book..."
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Great tasting menu.,Nov 2018 •,I have been visiting rome for over 40 years (this fall for a month) and I was attacted to ad hoc because of the truffles.

In Rome you can find hundrets restaurants, but for sure Ad Hoc is one of the best. Next time we will be back 100%."
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Lovely evening,Dec 2018 •,Found this place on trip advisor and decided to give it a go. We was very lucky we got a table as we didn’t book (recommend making a reservation) and they managed to just squeeze us in. Food was lovely. Restaurant is gorgeous and romantic. Loved the glass of wine we received as soon as we sat down as well at the little desserts they bought us after the meal. We wasn’t going to order a dessert but let’s be fair we all have a little room for one if they are going to bring one over. Also the little bottle of olive oil was a lovely touch to take home
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Excellent,Dec 2018 •,"Service was excellent, extreme attention to details. Great food. Nice location and warm setting. Highly recommend"
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,A little dissapointed,Dec 2018 •,"This is the eighth time I have had dinner at Ad Hoc, so needless to say, I am a fan. But the dinner I had last night was a bit dissapointing. For 250 euro a couple for a prix fixe
Menu, You'd expect to be blown away, and honestly, I was not. 
I had the black truffle menu, usually a solid choice. We started off with slow service and an amuse bouch that was a tasteless spinach purée. The carbonara continues to be as good as it gets, but a lot of the truffles were flat and fairly weak. The wine pairings were good with 3 out of 4 being stunning. The wine steward is great and she took the time to explain all the selections. The rest of the food was okay, and the suckling pig was a winner. There were three rounds of deserts, but I was too stuffed to really plow through them. The prix fixe came with a conolli that was great, a pannacotta that was blah and a good tiramisu that has somehow become a standard on all Roman restaurant menus. 
Service was choppy and once the high rollers began ordering truly expensive wines, they garnered all the attention. It was just not the friendly and personal experience that I have been accustomed to, and the evening was a bit of a let down. 
Would I go back? That remains to be seen."
Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Wonderful,Oct 2018 •,"We visited Ad Hoc for my wife’s birthday, from the moment we arrived to leaving we were looked after to highest standards by all of the staff. They were attentive, helpful and above all extremely knowledgable about there wine and food. The wine was great and the food with it’s attention to detail was truly wonderful. I can’t wait to go again and would highly recommend this restaurant to my friends and family."
Poland,Stara Kamienica,Negative,Awful and unfriendly service,Jun 2024 •,"Service took to long
We asked several time for a speedier service as we had to attend an event
When we ordered their speciality Pirogi and pork chops was not available, so a large part of their menu was not to be ordered 
When we wanted to pay separately we had a very aggressive waiter that didn’t want to do it making weird explanations.
The tone was very aggressive and almost a little bit physical.
He was totally not open to feedback.
We were all shocked and have a good story to tell to the other 150 delegates of the event.

But that is no problem because he doesn’t care as he explained to us that he is the best waiter in Warsaw.
Perhaps also in Poland.
Excuse me would have been a better reaction"
Poland,Stara Kamienica,Negative,Unbelievable boring food,Apr 2024 •,The food was very tasteless. The meet was dry and felt like heated up with a micro owen. Embarrassing that the waiter gave a card and ask for recommendations in trip advisor. It’s very hard to understand their high recommendations. Don’t go there!!!
Poland,Stara Kamienica,Negative,Confirm then confirm then check again if booking here🤬,Dec 2022 •,"Would love to of visited, however the place needs to seriously sort it's booking system.
We booked a table for Saturday night on the Thursday evening, then having read a previous review of somebody not getting their booking we revisited the place on Saturday morning/lunchtime to confirm our booking. We were told it was all fine and our name and number were in the book. Fast forward to Saturday evening and looking forward to a nice meal for our last night in Warsaw and upon arrival we were told, sorry you have no reservation and must have the day wrong and that it was for the Sunday. Pretty unlikely being as we fly home early Sunday and had confirmed the booking less than 12 hours earlier.
They need to have a hard look at their booking procedures if they are to avoid many more 1* disappointments😡"
Poland,Stara Kamienica,Negative,Ruined my birthday,Nov 2022 •,"We made a reservation weeks ago, asking for a nice table because it would be my birthday.

When we arrived, three people rudely ‘welcomed’ us saying they were full and everything was reserved. My wife said she had a reservation and they looked at her as if she was lying. When she showed the reservation, the girl who had made it said it was a mistake and there was nothing she could do for us. We could come back the next day...

So we left and could ofcourse not find another nice restaurant, as it was Saturday evening and very busy in town.

What was supposed to be a special evening was ruined by the terrible ‘service’ of this restaurant."
Poland,Stara Kamienica,Negative,Mixed experience,Sept 2022 •,"It was likely an off night - we were warned that the food would take about 30 min, but ended up waiting an hour for the mains. The beef tartare, deer roast and deer ragout were fine, not exceptional, but worth the price. At the end of the meal, my male partner was served a complimentary shot of vodka, while I (female) was offered a rose instead - come on, guys, we are in 21st century Europe..."
Poland,Stara Kamienica,Negative,Nice and lovely but somewhat disappointing,May 2017 •,"Overall nice, but I wouldn't pick it again. The meat was nice (Veal and Duck, two dishes), but quite tasteless. Prices so so."
Poland,Stara Kamienica,Negative,Disappointing.,Apr 2017 •,"With so many positive reviews, our expectations were too high.
The service wasn't exactly bad, but quite slow and unattentive. We were seated in the back, close to the restrooms.
We ordered boar, which was OK, but the garnish wasn't fresh.
When we paid, my partner got a complimentary drink (no word on what it was... Peach schnapps, maybe?) and I got a half-withered rose. They really didn't have to do that..."
Poland,Stara Kamienica,Negative,:(,Jan 2017 •,"Terrible service, bad food. We ate at Stary Dom the night before were everything was great, so this was a let down for us."
Poland,Stara Kamienica,Negative,Just ok,Oct 2016 •,"Reading the recommendations of this restaurant, expectations were left much higher than the actual outcome.
Service and atmosphere was nice, but the food...not so great. Specially the chefs recommendation (roasted neef) was poor, wouldn't recommend it myself."
Poland,Stara Kamienica,Negative,Good food but ripped off!!,Oct 2016 •,Clearly we don't speak or read polish and they added on an extra course which we didn't question (our stupidity) as it seemed such a nice place! So an extra 39zlt. Ok not much but still tarnished what was a great night! Food was great atmosphere amazing but just ripped off!! If you visit here and the bill doesn't add up! Question it!!
Poland,Stara Kamienica,Negative,poor touristy bad quality,Jan 2016 •,"Service was awful and long, waitress discouraged our group of five to order and suggested it will be better if we leave just after the meat and cheese board was served. never again

almost forgot that received a margerita with salt"
Poland,Stara Kamienica,Negative,"Good food, poor management.",Dec 2015 •,"Nothing to complain about the food, but I feel we were not fairly treated; we booked (and received confirm) our table two weeks in advance, because restaurants tend to be pretty full during  pre-Christmas days. When we arrived we were offered a table in front of the bar, near the entrance door that, unlike most restaurants in winter,  had neither heavy curtains nor double doors to protect guests from cold gusts. Moreover, the door is saloon-like, so that whenever someone used it, we enjoyed a complimentary cold draft…! We asked to be moved to another free table inside the dining room, but they refused: that table remained empty for the whole evening, they only used it for laying the leftovers of the nearby large company.
The restaurant is also badly lit, with terrible energy-saving light bulbs (you could find better ones nowadays !)."
Poland,Stara Kamienica,Negative,I expected more regarding other visinom coments,Nov 2015 •,"I get burned dish, disappointing. The interior is pleasant and the waiters are fast but what we've come for is the food."
Poland,Stara Kamienica,Negative,Pretty mediocre,May 2024 •,Pretty mediocre. Having a hard time believing that this is one of the best restaurants in Warsaw. Was half empty on a Friday night and it was actually vacuumed during dinner.
Poland,Stara Kamienica,Negative,Very bad,Dec 2023 •,"We went to the New Year's Eve dinner and the food was bad.
Acceptable appetizers even if they brought cold meatloaf, but maybe that's how they serve it in their countries.
But not the tuna flooded with soy sauce. It was very salty
Maybe we Italians are used to eating well."
Poland,Stara Kamienica,Positive,Simple food done exceptionally!,Feb 2024 •,"One of our best finds in Warsaw! Simple polish-fare done extremely well.
